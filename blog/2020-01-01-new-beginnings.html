<p>I seem to go through repeatable phases in life, after spending enough time and money getting comfortable, my mind and heart dream of new, purer adventures. After more than 5 years in Wellington, I felt the need to shake things up again.</p>
<p>Adventure calls, and this time it's a return to a more rudimentary living, and one with more meaning.</p>
<p>I'm off to Madagascar - to help <a href="https://onja.org/">Onja.org</a> with their non-profit initiative to help Malagasy students become web developers.</p>
