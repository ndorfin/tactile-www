title: Building the Resilient Web
summary: If access to The Internet was a human right, wouldn't web developers need their work certified?

<p>
  The more I think about The Internet as a public service, or even a basic human right, the more I think about how we're failing our fellow users. Reflexively, I think of the classic analogy of Civil Engineers laying out infrastructure, each one certified for their work, producing conduits for us to go about our lives safely, more simply, and quicker than we would without them. Most importantly though, meeting minimum standards means deaths can be avoided.
<p>
  One could argue that as web developers, we don't need to be certified to do our jobs, as there aren't lives hanging in the balance of our work, or are there? As The Web weaves its way into our worldly lives, is it not possible that the implementation decisions we make could determine whether someone lives or dies?
<p>
  Couldn't Denial of Service be construed as a death sentence? Think about Accessibility in this context: How many people are you turning away from your site, because you didn't consider the impact of your implementations? As government and civil service websites go, hosting an inaccessible website can lead to class action lawsuits, because service is owed to each citizen, not the elite few.
<p>
  Nobody knowingly denies service to others, right?
<p>
  The irony is not lost on me, a Front-end Developer and Internet User, as I try to:
<ul>
  <li>navigate buggy interactions in multiple modal dialogs,
  <li>wait for loading spinners to eventually disappear,
  <li>find alternative options to the white screens of death, and
  <li>start over on a lengthy job application form because it died for some reason.
</ul>

  Introspectively, it's frustrating, de-humanising, and doesn't make my clawing anxiety any better either. -->

<h3>The silent contract of working on The Web</h3>
<p>
  When The Web exploded out onto the world stage, there were both written and unwritten rules for building websites. One in particular struck a chord for me. You were building a representation of your company, or your identity, as it exists in the physcial world. The personal services you offered to the world were mirrored and then amplified on The Web.

<h3>The Rule of Least Power</h3>
<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<h3>THe priorities of constituencies</h3>
<h3>Progressive rendering of tables vs. JS doesn't execute</h3>


It's like everyone has forogtten how to be Web Developers.
Take the Web out of Web Development
