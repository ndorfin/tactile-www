		<p>Sheesh but this week has been quick.  Yesterday I did the skating-in-the-basement thing again.</p>
		<p>Why is it that when one shows off, you make a fool of yourself too :D  Picture it, I've just got the cornering-overstep technique creamed, I'm cruising thru the basement like a PMS'ed woman (No offense girls :D) yet smiling at the late-night cleaning staff as I'm going thru the swinging motions.  4 paces later and suddenly the centre of gravity had shifted 10 meters in front of me.  I was flying to the ground :D  Landed on my thighs and elbows and got a nice filthy roasty on my right elbow.  Yay! :D</p>
		<p>Work has been kinda interesting.  I've been training Zahir in the skills he'll need as a UI goon, he's attentive and thorough, oh, and nervous :D  Got home and then schooled Nitr0s in teh_art.  That night I couldn't sleep cos I was thinking too much about semantic HTML. :/</p>
		<p>No update on the Porra-Saga.</p>

		<p>Friday, such a long time ago, I purchased a new pair of entry-level fitness skates (inline skates or rollerblades). I forgot to get the body to go with it.</p>
		<p>After trying out my brother's pair down in Cape Town, under the moonlight for many a night, I decided to get my own.  I haven't laughed at myself in such a long time, slipping and sliding, often followed by falling on my arse or hands. Imagine a giraffe, ungainly, never trusting its own legs.  Now give that giraffe two pairs of skates and push it down a hill. Heh, I must look like that.</p>
		<p>This morning I packed my gear into the car and headed into work as usual.  Then earlier this evening when most of the nerds had left, I whipped out the skates and proceeded to further my exploration in the field of balance and rhythym.  iPod playing, smooth-as-a-baby's-backside-concrete-bas<wbr />ement-floor whizzing underneath my fresh skates and not so fresh limbs.  There is something to be said about the difference in skating when you're listening to hard-rock (like: A - Nothing) or some cheesy dramatic song (like: Air - Alone in Kyoto). Anyway, had fun burning it up and evading the staring lab-rats.</p>
		<p>Feeling more confident about the skating, just the braking needs some work before I try new techniques :D</p>
		<h3>Rejection, in all its forms.</h3>
		<p>Hmm, bravery or stupidity makes me declare that I tried my hand at an online dating service. Heh. "Shaun, what would your mother say!".  So yeah, I experimented. Contacted someone who's profile looked interesting, she's now hidden her profile.  Then I contacted someone who's quite prominennt in the online scene.  She's now modified her bio to say: "Please don't be mad if I don't reply..." and now accepts members of the same sex as potential dates. Heh.</p>
		<p>Ladder Theory?  Online?!? o.O  Oh well, the experiement hasn't ended.  I keep saying: "Hey, at least I don't fake that I'm christian to pick up chicks at Youth" like someone I know. One thing is true, I must look like a mad-humping-rabbit-type, just wanting to go down in the burrow with each and every furry-bun-bum I lay eyes on. I blame other men for that.</p>
		<h3>In unrelated news...</h3>
		<p>Manic Street Preachers have an old song called: Tsunami.  Quite haunting, especially with the indo-asian instruments playing in the background.</p>
		<blockquote>

		<h3>On the northern front...</h3>
		<p>Come end of Feb, if things go the right way, I'll be winging my way to Lisbon, Portugal. I'm already considering learning a tad porra :D  Portugal is one of those places that I know nothing of, except for the fact that its almost slipping off the European continent or is regarded as the lost province of Spain.</p>
		<p>Really looking forward to all the challenges it will present.  A language barrier, travelling on my own, and best of all, getting some solid work done with total strangers.  Can't wait to see what life is like there.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I was bold, almost foolish.  I had a new toy and I was ready to show it off to anyone who would see it.</p>

			<p>Hand outstretched, into the darkness. My mind illuminating the way, the way before my fingertips. Moving still, till the elbow clicked in its socket.</p>
			<p>Waving my fingers like live bait in the fish infested waters, teasing for a bite. A passer by, an ignoramus.  A full-stomach one, and a confused one. Stupid little fish.</p>
			<p>A BITE! I've got one! REEL IT IN, QUICK!</p>
			<p>The line lay limp like a lifeless leech. Damnit.</p>
			<p>Earl leaned over from the other side of the boat: "Shaun, you've got to make them little slippery buggers think they've won.  If they feel they've lost, they'll not spend another ounce of energy!"</p>
			<p>"I don't want the sissys goddamnit!  I want the fighters! I want the greedy ones!" I snapped back at Earl like a barracuda.</p>
			<p>Earl turned around and carried on whistling to the water, always the same tune.</p>
			<p>Later that evening, Earl and I sipped on Bourbon while the moon danced above our camp fire.  Earl landed a big one that day, I went to sleep with a full belly and a mind unsettled by new experiences.  Now if only these crickets could learn to sleep too.</p>

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/18039.html'></a> <h3>I've missed you, why?</h3>
		<p>A dream I had this morning...</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I don't know where I am.  It feels like South Afirca.  I see warnings, warnings of great pain towards me and my old love interest, M.</p>
			<p>M is the star of her own SA made TV series, and now it feels like the episode has started, with me. I haven't seen M for ages. The warnings in the beginning were like a teaser for the episode. I see many of the teaser bites later on, specifically the dungeon, embraced in pain.</p>
			<p>I'm here to collect M's great aunt. We arrive in Boston, but the airport doesn't look familiar.  Instead, I'm getting a documentary overview of the city, as if I was watching a tourist information clip about the city.</p>
			<p>M's aunt and I are on a weird jerking tram system, it makes all the old ladies on it feel uncomrfortable, yet they know they're safe because they've done it so many times before.  M's aunt is rattling off to me, telling me of many things, but I'm not paying attention, maybe even ignoring her. The tram weaves thru strange unknown parts of Boston and at one point all the old women aboard time it perfectly: They throw bread out the tram's open air windows into a lake which is already covered in soggy bread and a multitude of white and patchy geese.</p>
			<p>We move on, and soon I am seperated from the old ladies. My tram takes me towards a more rural side of "Boston", another familiar place but not visually familiar at all.  I'm skipping along the main street, high above the houses, hopping over the roofs. Then I see her.</p>
			<p>Her back is to me as she's working in the vegetable garden at side of what can only be called a hut. Its a regular rectangular shaped thing with a flat roof.  I descend from the air in my last leap and land next to her without making a noise.  I embrace her and kiss her lightly on the neck.  She's missed me.  She looks different, more nautral, I can't decide for better or worse, but I still love her.</p>
			<p>She's worried about the state of health of her aunt, yet greatly relieved to see me. I feel so at home with my head in her neck, watching her smile, hearing her voice, caressing her.</p>
			<p>After a few more close moments, we head into town.  We're headed to a dungeon of sorts.  When we arrive, we're walking around the central complex, above a pit or moat of some sort, where inside, there are vast screens of numbers, all laser projected and counting down or up.  47, 54 or 57 the one said. Its mad, this place looks like an asylum, or jail.  In the towering inner complex, I can make out faces of people behind terminals, who I can only classify as agents. They're studying numbers or inteliigence.</p>
			<p>We walk round the outer complex some more, when the ramp up to M's aunt's room on the ground floor is number free. (the projected numbers are like laser beams, motion detectors.) Inside her open air room is M's aunt and 2 other people. One, a great old female friend whole loves M's aunt very much and the other is a doctor type who I can also assume is female.</p>
			<p>M at this stage is very distrrught. She doesn't want to be here, but we take up two seats anyway. I'm not touching M. M's aunt is sitting in the corner between her old friend and the doctor. Her friend has her arm on her lap, consoling her. M's aunt is looking very bad at this stage, totally different to how I saw her on the tram. No hair, in hospital robes and very weathered. She's lapsing in and out of conciousness. My focus is on M, when her aunt starts speaking: "I just saw his hand and pen disappear" I look down and sure enough, I'm waving a long pen around in front of me, with my elbows on my knees, leaning forward. M starts to cry.  I look at M's aunt from M's perspective and all I'm thinking is: "Go easy old lady, move on, pass on without pain!"</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>I don't know if M's aunt passed or not, but some voice explained to me that when M's aunt said she couldn't see the pen in my hands, that part of my essence had flown into her at that moment, and I was weakened by it.</p>
		<p>I want to see M again. I want her to love me too.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I was just cresting the hill when I eased off the jetpacks, I could feel the heat thru the power armor cladded to my back.</p>
		<p>There he was, taunting me on the horizon, again.  He was nimble and I was struggling to keep up.  With a deep breath I descended down the hill towards my target, gaining speed as my anti-grav insulator did its work.</p>
		<p>At the bottom of the hill I was doing close to 150km/h when I instinctively braced for the kick-up-the-arse in the form the jetblast as I hammered the throttle.  Alitmeter rose, I armed my fusor as I saw the horizon again, no sight of that stinky derm.</p>
		<p>Radar revealed nothing, comms were dead quiet, but I knew that derm had to be around here somewhere, I could feel the hairs on my back tingle as I realised he was right behind me, hiding in a nook of the summit. I was trapped!</p>
		<p>Slowly I turned around, until I got a full view of the derm, standing alert.</p>
		<p>"Put down your fusor newblood! That won't help you here!"</p>
		<p>"You are quick and sneaky for a derm" I retorted as I threw the Stormhammer to the ground in front of me.</p>
		<p>His lips bared teeth, "You still have much to learn my sardine-tin-friend, you're skilled, but skill won't save you here - You need honour!<br />There is more to this existence than kill-or-be-killed. There is wisdom amongst the older warriors, something you will share one day."</p>
		<p>I felt like I had my pants around my ankles, yet enlightened.</p>
		<p>I can still remember his voice to this day: patient, precise and well practiced.  I have not seen this derm for ages, but I know he's teaching the old code somewhere out there. I have much respect for him, the one they call XPENDABLE!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Dear Forgotten Diary,</p>
		<p>I write to you, in a tone I'd rather not use. See, it's been a while, and I've been missing you, but at the same time, I hate you.  I hate what you've made me.  I love you, I'll kill you.</p>
		<p>I'm stuck, halfway between the crack and zen. Sharp tendrils, cut into my skin and attached to the bone, anchor me down.</p>
		<p>I bumped into one of your friends the other day.  What a confused soul it is.  It is the type that thinks you can get something without working for it.  It is the type that preaches one thing, but plays another. I saw right thru it.</p>
		<p>Been feeling quite dispondent since I've returned to SA. I had so many expectations, expectations that were maybe too high.  I'm stuck in the same trap, when will I learn my lessions? *sigh* I've set myself goals that I knew were unreachable, and now disappointed with my results.</p>
		<p>In other news, work is going well.  I was offered a promotion.  The work content has been bad, but because its so clinical and distant. I want to spill the guts with my own hands.</p>
		<p>Looking forward to my holiday in Cape Town. Looking forward to escaping all these drugs. Looking forward to looking forward.</p>
		<p>Anyway, thats it for now. Please stop those feelings you create within me.</p>

		<p>I was fortunate enough to have a guided tour through the avenues of mentorship, cognac and sushi last night.  A friend from the office became a good friend in the space of 4 hours. 4 hours I spend contemplating for much longer than 4 hours :)</p>
		<p>It all started with good quality red wine (well it tasted good at any rate) and sushi.  A much better experience in sushi than my first. While she was teaching me the finer art of japanese cuisine, she was also imparting much knowledge. Here's a gal I knew very little of and ended up sharing a great evening with.</p>
		<p>After watching the wine disappear and mulling over the taste of sushi, we decided to head through to another restaurant that featured a lounge with a live jazz trio. Sipping on Mojitos, and a Mangarita later, idly chatting openly about such things as our make up (no, not make-up) the evening was almost over.  Well, my guide through these new experiences wasn't going to let me go to sleep without sharing the Cognac Experience&trade; with me. She's a very talented photographer, so we went over a few of her pieces and savoured (and sometimes choked :D) on the Cognac. I was learning how to be cultured! Mom would be proud :)</p>
		<p>This morning, the drowsiness of the hangover was soon superceded by the graceful thoughts of reliving such a pleasant evening. An experience I wish to repeat when the opportunity arises again.  Reach out people. Try new things.</p>
		<h3>nnnDorfin - a net novel</h3>
		<p>A while ago I created a new blog template on blogspot.  I've been mulling over a few novel ideas, and secured 3 so far. I'm gonna give the NaNoWriMo a go, just for the hell of it.  Watch this space.</p>
		<p>The first idea is based on my passion for central american culture.  More specifically the advent of Quetzalcoatl in Mayan / Toltec culture. (JFGI).  It will require a lot more research than I hoped, but it'll be good for me.  The second, a psychological drama of a young man and his adventures through paradise.  And lastly, but certainly the most cheesy, a solider story with a twist(ed pair). Maybe my NaNoWriMo could be the three short stories together.  We'll see.  30 000 words is an achievement on its own, something I haven't reached through all this blogging yet (well, what little I have written :D).</p>
		<h3>Another weekend - to be spent</h3>
		<p>Tonight we're heading off to Worcester (the one in MA, not SA :D) to do some ice skating, then tomorrow its Mandy's birthday. We're gonna go check out the Musuem of Fine Arts, followed by some shopping and then hooking up with buddies at the Hard Rock Cafe.</p>
		<p>My CD's arrived today.  I got 7 CD's for $100, R100 a CD in my opinion is not bad!  These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adema - Adema (Thought: What the hell!)</li>
			<li>Dave Matthews Band - Crash (Really enjoying his stuff, so I splashed out on his classics)</li>
			<li>Filter - Title of record (Looking forward to this one)</li>
			<li>Groove Armada - Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) (Just cos its kewl)</li>
			<li>KoRn - Greatest Hits (Word up!)</li>
			<li>Madonna - Ray of light (Bought this for my mom when it came out, been missing it like I miss my mom :/</li>
			<li>St. Germain - Tourist (My theme songs for my experiences over here)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I look forward to seeing all my friends and family when I return to SA on the 13th. Can't wait!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<h4>Itchy mind-scab 1: Festering.</h4>
		<p>There's this one guy at the office, who I can only describe as a passionate listener, nay, a listening fetishist.</p>
		<p>I have mental images of this guy wanting to step up and crawl inside your mouth, peering inside to see what your brain has to reveal. When you talk to him, he has this little smirk on his face, likes hes totally dependent on your every word, like a bloodthirsty paparazzi type journalist finding a scoop on the hottest celeb, well almost.</p>
		<p>I can just picture his tail wagging and him tilting his head everytime you say: Spot wants to catch the ball!  Oh well, when he talks, the effect is lost (as they say). Its all conspiracy this, and screw the corporation that. Still, an interesting oke.</p>
		<h4>Mind-scab 2: Almost healed.</h4>
		<p>Recently, I had the unfortunate experience in using UPS. A package was to be delivered to my door at the hotel, but instead I got a little postcard which said something like: "We were unable to deliver to your address because the address seemed incorrect.". Now, how the hell did the postcard get delivered, to the correct address, but the package didn't!?  Anyway, the instructions on the postcard said I should stop by some regional distribution centre and pickup the package myself!  What Cheek.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, in my new found grief for UPS, I started stalking the brown trucks, imagining interesting ways to render them useless, or abduct the drivers and subject them to something as evil as working for edocs. On the side of these butt-ugly trucks is a UPS national call centre number: <b>1-800-PICK-UPS</b>. I just chuckled - Idjits.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

			<p>If I set the blinds to slits, and wait for the sun to set and the lights to come on.</p>
			<p>If I sit here on this chair and try catch a glimpse of the outside.</p>
			<p>(If I feel the need to write about something like this, what the hell...)</p>
			<p>If I bob my head up and down in time with some stupid song I've heard over and over...</p>
			<p>... the lights behind the slits in the sunless outside seem to flicker, strobe.</p>

		<p>Hmm, NaNoWriMo is weighing heavy on my lazy mind.  I feel like I want to achieve something like that, but at the same time I keep thinking I don't have what it takes to write a journal entry for each day of a whole month.  What the hell would I write about anyway?  I also have an impending trip back to SA. (oh, you just have to enter a novel by the 30th. - that's better.)</p>
		<p>Where has all my energy gone?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>6 hours drive, for what should have been 3, we arrived in Sugarbush Ski Resort, Vermont. The place we're staying in, owned by a very magnamonous colleague, is great.  Dressed to the nines, as much as a condo in a resort could be.  This place oozes quality.</p>
		<p>After much Agave and cervezas, went to bed in a total chill on Friday night.  I don't think I've ever felt this good off alcohol before. Woke up around 10:30 ish, to a cup of tea and bacon and eggs.</p>
		<p>Shortly after, we hopped in the car in search of a special cheese factory, which we couldn't find.  Still, the view from the window world whizzing by was mindblowing. I've never seen such lively colours before.  Some trees were yellow as the ass of a bumblebee, while others loooked like they were on fire. Meadows of green, white picket fences and this sea of yellow and red.</p>
		<p>We decided to take a walk to the summit of the range, up an autumn ski-route. Pretty tough on the calves, but the view from the top was worth it.  It was great to feel warm underneath a jacket, in the middle of nowhere, and enjoying the cold breeze against the face.</p>
		<p>We got back to some hot tea, and some games of cards by the fire.  The rest of the evening went something like: "Eat, Drink and be merry." :) Thats when I started writing this entry.</p>
		<p>I've only just finished it.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<blockquote>
			<p>Fluffy rug, thick and hearty, my back over the length of it.  Intoxicated with red wine, enjoying the moment. Your bum, alongside but close to my hip, your legs stretched out towards the fire that burns behind you.</p>
			<p>Songs fill the air, songs of favour, songs of loneliness.  I can't figure out if it is my mind dictating the chorus, or its actually a recognised artist. Your eyes reflect the flickering fire bouncing off the walls, they're fixated on my face, my smile.</p>
			<p>You're savouring my every word, as if it was the sweet caress of chocolate on your tongue.  When I make you laugh, its like I'm tickling inside, I know that you're so into me, you're almost helpless, and I'm your guardian.</p>
			<p>Your elbow, once or deemed sharp, is softly sprawled over my stomach.  You're as a light as the kiss of an angel, you couldn't harm anything.  I just want to hold you, my fragile.  You're like butter in my hands, melting and slipping through my figners.</p>
			<p>My palm stretches from the base of your chin while my fingertips tickle your ear, you're so delicate.  My thumb could wipe a tear from the groove beneath your eye, but you're not crying. When you close your eyes like you do now, I know you can feel me.  You press your face against my hand, wanting more.</p>
			<p>My hand is really just a junction between two great sources of energy, I want to share all mine with you.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Synchronous in thought. Synchronous in action.</p>

			<p>Speed limit increased.  Valves openly respond.</p>
			<p>Consumption up, oxygen short.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Its almost 8PM, I'm sitting here in the car after a hard gym session, waiting for Mandy and Gareth to finish their sets.  Dodging the weird glances from the leaving ignorants.</p>
		<p>What's the difference between jotting down thoughts in paper vs sitting in the car with the laptop in front of you.  Maybe the weird stares are based off my ability to type in the dark.</p>
		<p>The gymming fraternity is a whacky lot.  Some people are so obsessed with their appearance they could be classed in the same category as anorexics.  Its a sickness.  Some stare for ages at their bodies in the mirror.  Frankly, I don't understand what women see in men who are overly huge from working out so much. Even ape-like.  They even LOOK stupid.  I wonder how many of them could jog a mile?</p>
		<p>But thats me, being judgemental again.</p>
		<p>Got word we're going on holiday soon. Life is good.</p>
		<h3>Then today, 9PM EDT (or is that EST?) on a week ago.</h3>
		<p>Work has been terrible.  I've been battling to concentrate, even trying to organise tasks into priorities results in procrastination.  I was at my wit's end when I was verbally reprimanded for my <cite>lack of performance</cite> by one of the big boys.  This just got me more upset, especially when I found out <em>how</em> my performance was being evaluated.  A few frantic phonecalls to the captain back home and I was on a new course, Destination: Relaxation, only I had to get out of the rough seas first.</p>
		<p>I've been escaping into my gaming, playing lots of Warcarft III, and being totally mindless.  Watching TV is bad, especially all the crap they play on the hundreds of TV channels here.  Its so addictive, I suck on a beer, chow on my oily crisps and feel my mind dribble out my nose. At least I'm still drinking Heineken and not sagging to low standards such as Bud.</p>
		<p>The social scene is non-existent, except chilling with Mandy and Gareth.  Did lots of day-walking last weekend around some beautiful reservations in Boston.  One within walking distance of our hotel.</p>
		<h3>Also today, 9:15PM ED/ST (bleh: +5 GMT) on this weekend.</h3>
		<p>Beunos Noches Mis Amigos! (Hope my spelling is right)</p>
		<p>Work had an end in sight, and after being <cite>told off</cite> I had new direction and a goal to work towards. It goes a little something like this...</p>
		<p>On Thursday, Cake performed at the Orpheum theatre in downtown Boston. These guys are amazing. The whole way thru the concert I thought of Dudditts and Mc and how a joint would really go down well.  Cake are as good, if not better performing live.  They played classic singles such as "Comfort Eagle", "Rock &amp; Roll Lifestyle" and "Never There".  Some of the new stuff was good too, most notably: "No Phone". I left with a smile on my face knowing I had fulfilled a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a theme for the week.</p>
		<p>Friday night, we got home early-ish to pack. The company, in all its evil glory, had allowed us 4 days of vacationing in the destination of our choice under $500.  So we chose a package deal to Cancun, Mexico.</p>
		<p>Early Saturday morning, Mandy and I met up with Gareth in Cambridge and caught a lift into the airport for a sunrise flight to the land of short smiling people.  The flights were OK, got to see "The Terminal" finally, which I enjoyed.  When we touched down in Cancun, I was grinning from ear-to-ear, here I was, in a totally alien place, faced with a foreign languange and a huge foo-fighting itenerary.</p>
		<p>We picked up our rental car after queueing for hours in typical third-world-and-kinda-welcoming fashion, glistening with sweat from the humidity.</p>
		<p>The drive into Cancun was effortless, especially with Gareth (our intrepid interpretor and been-there-done-that kinda guy) at the helm.  Meh-Hee-Co, as pronounced by the locals, is like South Africa, with Botswana flavour, short jolly people and massive american cars.  It felt like home.</p>
		<p>Our hotel was exactly what I expected, mass populace, low on maintenance and always looked better in the brochure.  That didn't get in the way with bumming on the beach or driving the Yucatan flat.</p>
		<p>Our first full day we survived the drive to Tulum to see the seaside ruins left by the Toltecs and Mayans. (Well, technically the Spanish Conquistadors left what was left-over. Pigs.) The contrast between age-old stone, white beach, green palms and azure seas is a spectacle everyone should see before they die.  On the way back, we stopped off in Peurto Morales to catch some snorkelling and local flavours.  Picture it: dining in a cheesy Mexican, beach-fronting restaurant, sipping on cervezas and even catching a song or two from the local talent. I finally felt like I was relaxing. After wrapping up a mildly mannered meal, we were off to test the theory that one should never swim after lunch.  We were in for some luck.</p>
		<p>$20 later, we found a boatsman, Jose (fancy that!), gear and that exciting feeling in your stomach.  After testing out the equipment, we were on our way towards the reef.  Donning the flippers and mask, and diving into the water, I was bitterly disappointed.  Frikkin sea grass or some macro algae as far as the underwater eye could see. :(</p>
		<p>(Un)Fortunately we all had to wear life-vests and follow the boatsman-cum-diving-guide on a tour of the waters.  My disappointment quickly subsided (like I would've if it wasn't for the lifevest) when I first caught sight of a huge stack of brain coral, in very good nick.  Infused over its own patterns were shimmering patterns of schooling fish, beautiful!  Lone stacks of coral led to complex condos of piscine splendour. Parrotfish, Grey Angelfish, Trumpetfish, Boxfish, Neon Gobies, jeepers.  If I could let my jaw drop I would, but it was too busy keeping the snorkel in place.</p>
		<p>After an hour floating in the cool waters, abusing a poor starfish, and watching Gareth crap himself underwater from a Moray Eel, it was time to get back to the boat.  At this stage I had a headache from the pressure of diving too deep after our tour guide gave us the go ahead to ditch the life-vests.</p>
		<p>Day two was an early start, for Chichen Itza. After two hours of driving the poor Nissan Tsuru flat out on the road thru the jungle, we arrived at Chichen Itza with new found legs and a zest to see what the fuss was all about. Trees gave way to a huge grassy lawn and one towering temple in the form of El Castillo, a stone and earth calendar as old as mayan recorded time.  Toltecs had built over most of the Mayan temples, shrines to the shedding of human blood.  Grim, yes. Mysterious, absolutely.</p>
		<p>I particularly enjoyed the Steam Rooms and the Observatory, followed by the view from the top of El Castillo and the endless columns.  The heavens opened in sheer tropical fashion just as we were making our way back to the car, good timing from the rain-god: Chac Mool. I bought a fantastic medallion depiction of Quetzalcoatl, the man himself, for the bargain price of 200 Pesos.</p>
		<p>The route back was uneventful besides some wild driving antics a-la-Gareth and stopping for a few snaps of the cloudy skies, jungle and road. The extended metaphor that is my life. We chilled like we did all the previous days, walking on the beach, sipping beers and watching the hours tick by.  That evening after a better than average meal and one too many glasses of wine, Mandy and I dipped our toes in the night-time Atlantic and caught up on some heart-to-heart stuff.  One particular wave carried in a luminescent creature the size of a small bead, a dazzling blue, as if the day time sea colour was thousands of these little living gems.</p>
		<p>Day three, Mandy and Gareth got up early to catch the sunrise while I prayed to the slumber gods.  After packing up, we were abusing our little Nissan again to catch the midday flight in time.  Getting back into the US was particularly painful. Customs were their typical anal selves. I kept asking myself: Why do I feel like a criminal?  Thoughts of wanting to flee gave way to feelings of familiarity, home almost.</p>
		<h3>Also today, 10:15PM</h3>
		<p>Its now my little brother's Birthday. Best wishes Mike, for your 23rd Birthday. I hope to spend more with you in the future.</p>
		<p>This weekend we're cruising up to Vermont, to catch the autumn / fall in all its fiery glory. I just hope I don't have too much work to do.</p>
		<p>So long for now people. Remember, this is a two way-street.  I'll post photos some other time.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Work = bad right?  Well, while it really has been bad, its also been amazing.</p>
		<p>Behind all the friviluous machinations that is corporate policy, and feeling like a number all over again, I feel like I've grown.  The responsibilities are starting to load up, most of them good responsibilities.  The type that you don't have to be a manager.</p>
		<p>Way back when, when I was young and naive, (wait, I still am! :P) I told myself I would never stop being a techie.  I'd much rather have my head buried in code than worry about managing a project or a team of people.  That's changed.  I'm feeling empowered, and revel in the opportunity to lead a team, impart knowledge on my peers, superiors and subordinates (damn, thats a terrible word).</p>
		<p>Recently edocs gave me the opportunity to conduct a techinal interview with a potential new applicant. I felt more nervous than the applicant, but in the end it went off well.  Its great to reach out on a personal level almost, not just: "Pass this parameter please".</p>
		<p>I've also been doing some research into the possibility of running a school of sorts within edocs.  HTML and CSS skills are lacking, so I approached the <acronym title="Vice President">VP</acronym> with a plan, which he accepted and wants me to do more research.  Within a few weeks I should hopefully be running 2-hour-long courses on web standards related HTML and CSS to any edocs people who are interested.  It's going to be challenging, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity.</p>
		<p>Other than that, with Tai, the Senior UI Developer on his <a href="http://think-360.blogspot.com" title="Browse.To: Tonic Boy&apos;s Travels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog-driven 2 month sabbatical</a>, I've had to take on a lot of the work he'd usually do.  One such project is an internal development kit for new client projects. Sheesh.</p>
		<p>In general, I'm feeling like a different person.  I was browsing through some old photos from the beginning of the trip (in June) and hardly recognised the skinny dork in all the photos.  It's amazing what a different diet and a loose gym routine can do.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>This is something I just want to get off my chest.  Here in the land of the "free" they have a keen distaste for islamic people. Granted, its a sweeping generalisation, but it still occurs.  Here in the land of the "liberated", terrorism is associated with Islam.  People, please, get it in your media-tuned minds that just because a bunch of fundamentalists cause a country so much grief, doesn't mean that the religion they so unshamelessly bastadardised is evil too.  In fact, I'd say many western civilists have much to learn about such rich and devoted religions as Islam and Buddhism.</p>
		<p>Here, if you're a "towel-head", even Indian, you're going to be repressed.  So much for the land of the "free" eh?  Talk about double standards.</p>
		<p>One question remains though: Why? Why the WTC in the most cosmopolitan city in the states?  I've never seen so many South and Central Americans, Pakistanis and Hindus in one city.  If you want to bomb america, at least do a good job and get rid of the towers of untruth in the form of media magnates and the towers of such sick "liberties" as the pr0n industry. Ask yourself Why America.</p>
		<p>As for this shazbot debacle in the form of elections, who the hell does a red-neck or a banker vote for?  You have George "Dubya" Bush (what kinda nickname is that - testament to the bastardisation of the western civilised), or even John Kerry.  Not a great list of candidates eh?  Frankly, as Gareth says, I would vote against Bush rather than voting for Kerry.</p>
		<p>I'm so glad I don't live here.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">
