	<p>I feel a bond, but I wonder where it's connected.  I saved her once, I pulled her out of the clutches of the water, the water she was drowning in.  I saved her once, I'm always there to save her again.  But now it's different.  I want her to save me.  This is not water I'm drowning in.</p>
	<p>I was a child back then, with the responsibilities of an adult.  I was handed over to the custodians, into the arms of conformity, maturation and responsibility.  Maturing too early, too responsible too early.  How can I live if I haven't learnt how to live?  Does my nine to five make me who I am?  Does my breeding of control mean I can't really let go, can't walk around naked, can't speak my mind or can't even laugh at myself?</p>
	<p>When did I become who I am today?  When did I lose that childish innocence, being exposed to nothing I didn't find curious or fun.  When did I make the decision to not let go, to not be like everyone else, to derive my success from standing on the shoulders of my peers?  What have my peers done for me recently?  Am I the one serving through the hatch?  Give me your fucking money - this is a robbery!</p>

Go on, take another bite, but don't come back bitching when the fat has gone to your thighs and you're fucking miserable all over again.  Don't people learn from their mistakes?

<p>Don't quote me on this... but some interesting figures sprang up using a few thumbsucks.  If you know the real figures, drop me a comment.</p>
<p>If we could draw a comparison of the data the brain handles to bytes, how much do you think it handles in a day?</p>
<h4>Visual.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Humans are awake on average for two thirds of their day. 16 hours.</li>
	<li>Our eyes take a maximum in of <a class="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes#Equivalent_resolution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">81 Megapixels</a>.</li>
	<li>What frame-rate do the eyese and visual cortex handle?  I heard some figure like 24 <acronym title="Frames Per Second">FPS</acronym>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do our eyes and visual cortex compress images?  Assume not. What colour depth do our eyes handle? Something better than 32bit? Assume 32bit (there are 8 bits per byte).</p>
<code>
81 million pixels * 4 bytes = 324 megabytes
324 megabytes * 24 = 7,776 megabytes per second
447,897,600 megabytes per woken day
</code>
<p>... or 448 terrabytes per day.</p>
<h4>Others?</h4>
<p>What about the sounds we hear?  Or the tactile input we receive?  Or the signals sent to and from the muscles?</p>
<p>What effect if any do the secretions of hormones have on brain activity and therefore data throughput?</p>
<p>I wonder if a comparison can be drawn between AI and data throughput.  What magical number of bytes per second (FLOP?) must a computer handle before it can be considered equivalent to the human brain?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

	<p>Mike and I are taking a walk through somewhere unfamiliar.  The road is sandy and eroded by rain. We're walking through an informal settlement, on this worn road.  I can't spot any other people in my periphery, it's just Mike and I.</p>
	<p>We stop for a moment since Mike is occupying his curiosity with something, I'm not sure what it is.  I peer down at my shoes and mess them about in the sand.  A glint of silver catches my eye, it's a 5 Rand Coin. I brush it with my foot and more are revealed.  4 in total.  I bend down to pick them up and Mike comes over to investigate, a new found curiosity.</p>
	<p>I go down on my knees.  As I move my hands through the soil, a Zippo lighter reveals itself.  It's corroded, but still intact.  Mike and I start digging.</p>
	<p>Our hands have no problems cutting into what should be hard-baked soil, and soon a full two-foot-long locker comes to the surface.  We open the lid.  A crowd has gathered to witness our exercise.</p>
	<p>I pull an item out of the locker.  It is shaped like a Zippo once again, but when I turn it over to reveal the top it is different.</p>
	<p>The top view reveals a cylindrical object, a barrel of sorts, with an internal grinding / bearing mechanism.  I pull the internal bearing out.  Attached to the internal bearing unit is a grafted seedling.  A weed seedling.  It's almost as if the weed plant is growing from the device as the roots go inside, and the weed plant is sprouting out from it, a new seedling.  It's beautiful, in a hybrid, mechanical kinda way.</p>
	<p>A shadow emerges over our excavation pit.  One of the squatter camp residents has come over to us, his eyes are flaming evil.  Mike and I have a new sense of urgency and try to lift the locker out the ground.  As we do so, the shadowy man puts his arm over my shoulders and provokingly asks me what we're doing.  I wake up.</p>

<h4>Why do chocolate manufacturers even bother with orange-filled chocolates?</h4>
<p><img alt="Quality Street" src="https://imgprx.livejournal.net/023f1f0843622ed828f5b56db028e07cbc94f564/6Qn-aL2IflYDKwNqGr1_0SyNqEJE37eYfnOc5hFQ2NQNIwnHeWqNTeFEZZe3GQ2_r-Zovu8auoADDWIWovw8XTgBKLQW22YXSH__j_CT0qYQwfsUFt3afL-2zutqIpKq_UNkU38PTXxVE42F-cf_ZY6Jx7-FT9fx0Y1i4_NVT60" width="386" height="158" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Take Quality Street as an example.  Some of the chocolates in your typical pack of quality street are these weird flavours like the cirtrusy Orange ones.  Leave a full pack of Quality Street out on the dining room table over christmas and I bet you... there'll just be these orange obscenities left.  They'd go off before anyone would eat them in my house.</p>
<p>Why bother with orange then?  I bet the Nestl&eacute; CEO likes the Orange flavoured ones and thus they were bundled with the rest.  Stupid CEOs create uselessness.</p>
<h4>Marketingspeak</h4>
<p><strong>All New!</strong></p>
<p><strong>New and Improved!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Free!</strong></p>
<p>Just some of the examples of terms in marketing you should (and safely could) ignore. WTF is All New anyway?  I love the way these inbred marketing folk refer to a new shape of motor car as "All New!".  Is the whole thing new?  I think not.  Is the <em>All</em> New? What is the all?</p>
<p>Just think of the impact such crappy use of English has on the new impressionable generation.  First myspace.com, then poor english.  What is this world coming to?</p>
<h4>Apartheid this, Struggle that.</h4>
<p>God.  It's been over 13 years since we became a free country.  Why does the Apartheid card have to be played over and over?  Our new enemy is incompetence, not racism, you grossly dysfunctional maggot-for-brains politicians. Please God, please instil some common sense in the new generation?  The new generation that'll be (b)leading our country?  Thanks. Oh and, please can I have a new trike?</p>

The converse is true as well, where the environment was total chaos, but we still got on with life.  Somehow the environment structures us too, either reactively or subconciously.</p>
<p>This entry follows <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/02/dont_ask_employ.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">an excellent article</a> at <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creating Passionate Users</a>, and seeing how my current employer is changing...  See here, it was a system of chaos (heh), but as more and more people join, the flat organisation needs structure and bureaucracy, apparently.  Which is better?  Chaos or Order?  Does this apply to the way people interact, or is it just about the work?</p>
<p>How about drawing an analogy between shooting-from-the-hip and sniping first.</p>

<h4>Shooting from the Hip</h4>
<p>Taking pot shots without looking down the gunsights can be a shitload of fun.  Especially when you can squeeze the trigger and let out the rounds in fully automatic.</p>
<p>Some more points to consider, yo.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can twist the handgun (gangsta-style) and bust a few caps and then a few caps more for good measure.  Take that nigga!</li>
	<li>Your accuracy sucks and bullets are costly.  All that money from your drug dealing means an endless supply of bullets anyway, so who cares!</li>
	<li>No matter that your accuracy sucks, you think you could shoot the fluffy-dice off your tricked out VTEC from a kilometre away.  That thinking alone makes you feel like a real man!</li>
	<li>Your handgun might be the property of another, but you use it within an environment where the property of another is actually yours anyway.</li>
	<li>Have you ever seen a gangsta running around with a wussy sniper rifle? Gangstas are in your face, shooting your shit, up close and personal.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sniping</h4>
<p>Sniping can be fun too.  It's a real challenge being able to drop a target from a click away.</p>
<p>Some points regarding Sniping</p>
<ul>
	<li>You're a quality, not quantity individual</li>
	<li>It took a long time to get to your sniping position, after stealthily sneaking up to your vantage point in your full-body camo</li>
	<li>You need a side-kick to spot targets and tell you if you dropped the target successfully.</li>
	<li>You could do it alone, but then who could corroborate your story?</li>
	<li>Your rifle and assistive technology probably costs more than your training</li>
	<li>...and it's taken you a long time to become a sniper.  You're one expensive employee!</li>
	<li>Your enemy won't know <acronym title="What the Fenang">WTF</acronym> hit them.  And if they survive, they'll probably only hear the explosive sound 3 seconds after they meet the ground, face first.</li>
	<li>While waiting for your fire order you resort to playing mental games to keep yourself occupied.</li>
	<li>Your work is impersonal. You can only see the effects of your work from a distance, and can never claim it as your own.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pros and Cons. (haha)</h4>
<p>Care to guess whether the Sniper or Gangsta was the ordered environment? Each side has its part to play I guess.</p>
<p>Draw the analogy to a close... let's see what it's all about:</p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Chaotic Workplace</th>
			<th>Ordered Workplace</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>(+) A natural source of creativity</td>
			<td>(-) Order often stifles creativity</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(-) Time wasted due to poor planning</td>
			<td>(-) Time wasted due to too much bureaucracy</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(+) Cheaper to run, save for hidden costs</td>
			<td>(-) More expensive to run</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(-) Uncertainty and change</td>
			<td>(+) People know where they stand</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(+) People driven by Passion</td>
			<td>(-) People driven by Pressure</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(+) Results are felt directly</td>
			<td>(-) Results are inherited, poorly</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>(+) The people doing the work are rewarded better</td>
			<td>(-) The people doing the work are keeping others buoyant</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Maybe the holy-grail of running a company is about:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reducing the bureaucracy effects in work</li>
	<li>Foster a creative and participative work ethic within your people. (Is this possible?  Isn't this down to who you employee - i.e. employ passionate people?  Doesn't the nature of the environment create passion?)</li>
	<li>Keep the people structure as flat as possible.  Managers (or rather: leaders) should take a personal interest in the work needs of their employees.</li>
	<li>Having an ordered, but non-invasive infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>(I realise that a number of points raised here are completely subjective. Am I that far off though?)</p>
<p>I say... we need a compromise between keeping the human relationships chaotic or natural, but the work structured.  And when I say the work should be structured, I mean that your work should be easy to fulfill.  It's about working smarter, not harder.  Don't involve me in your self-destructive politics.  Pat me on the back when I'm doing right and guide me from doing wrong.  Ask me how I'm doing without pressuring me with your stupid deadlines, ask me how things could be improved and LISTEN.  I have a voice.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/40952.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>The union</b></i></font><br></a> <p>This weekend saw an unusual set of circumstances befall those closest to me.  My brother got married, and in so doing, brought my family under one roof for just a night. Something that hasn't happened for easily 10 years.</p>
<p>There were so many questions governing our own insecurities as a broken family.  How would Mom and Dad react, being in the same room together (and in this case not a courtroom or judges chambers)?  How would we feel?  How could we spend time with either parent without choosing sides?</p>
<p>I resolved to casting preconceived notions aside and took in the experience for what it was: A time for love.</p>
<h4>The place</h4>
<p>Mike and Tess had chosen the Berea Presbyterian Church in North-Eastern Durban as the venue to be wed - as Tessa's mom, and her mom before her were married there.  At first it seemed like a hinderance, especially since the majority of witnesses and family resided in Johannesburg or further. Ritualistic tradition prevailed, and rightfully so.  There was a respectful memory to the air and about the whole weekend.</p>
<p>The reception too was held in the same place as parents before, at the Oyster Box Hotel in Umhlanga Rocks.  The hotel is soon to be revamped, so Mike and Tessa's timing was perfect... just before the memories got a new paint of coat and Super-Cheap replacement bathroom fittings.</p>
<h4>The process</h4>
<p>Back to the service, memories and surprises awaited Patrick and I as we walked inside the church grounds.  My Dad was outside, waiting with his sister (and my Aunt) Shiela and her husband Barry.  Dad seemed distant.  I hid my tail between my legs, especially since I hadn't seen my Aunt and Uncle for so long.  For some reason, I associated much pain with Dad and his side of the family.  An unfair judgement.  Seems they had moved on long before me.</p>
<p>My godmother and Mom's good friend Janet arrived.  Her daughter Shona had shed her childish frame and become a woman overnight. She still had that child-like glint to her eyes, a quality we should all have.</p>
<p>Patrick and I were given hymn-book handing-out duty, something I was happy to do, since I felt like I was entrusted with no particular duties at the wedding for the whole weekend.  Old friends, family and plenty of strangers poured into the church.</p>
<p>The formalities ensued, starting with Tess entering the church in the right arm of her proud father Steve. She looked gorgeous!  She was nervous, but in that giddy, girly kinda way.  Her smile was naturally electric. Mike was expectantly fidgeting at the pulpit, but keeping it cool. He looked suave :)</p>
<p>The service was quick, but quality (with a capital K).  The hymns made sense and were recognisable. Score more points for the Presbyterians! The Reverend was as efficient as his service, but dutiful and humble.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I had a new sister and a whole bunch of in-laws.  Photos followed, and then a following to the reception.</p>

<h4>Pleasantly surprised</h4>
<p>Ross, ol' Boots himself, was our <acronym title="Master of Ceremonies">MC</acronym> at the Reception.  He's an old-school good-guy, maybe too nice a guy to be a hit with the gals who don't look inside. (Who needs 'em shallow gals anyway!)</p>
<p>Mike's best man was Dudley, or Dudditts as I call him. Dudley can really be a clown... so a few of us were not expecting the speech he prepared for us.  I was blown away.  See if you do too...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]Thank you, Ross, for that generous introduction - Wonderfully restrained! I wouldn't have thought, considering your behaviour at the bachelors... but that's a story for another time.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Boys and Girls, On behalf of the bridesmaids, Who I must add are looking quite lovely, I would like to thank you all for joining us this evening to celebrate the union of mike and Tess. I would also like to thank all those who's hard work has made today possible. To the Parents of the couple for doing what was necessary to produce these two wonderful people and lastly to the bridesmaids themselves for keeping thing under control, I just imagine the ladies camp being a war zone.</p>
<p>As best man, please don't use that term too literally, I am supposed to SING THE GROOM'S PRAISES and tell you all about his MANY great attributes. Well, I'm very sorry but I CAN'T SING, and I WON'T LIE!</p>
<p>Born on October the 14th 1981, Michael Jon O'Connell from an early age showed an unusual inquisitiveness concerning how things worked. In fact I am quite sure the moment he popped out he must have thought to him self "hmmm I wonder how that works..."( hopefully he will find out tonight)  This trend has continued to this day producing some interesting ideas, and a few crazy results... mike perpetual motion will never work no matter how hard you try and if you ever built a tesla coil I guess I am going to be giving the speech at your funeral too.</p>
<p>During his early teenage years he was an avid bird watcher and even compiled a book which he appropriately titled the "Birds of Bryanston", unfortunately the next 10 years took a little bit of a horizontal shift, no doubt, he was still and avid bird watcher but he was more concerned with a particular species... the double breasted warbler. But he has, I might add, found an excellent specimen of the above species.</p>
<p>I decided to check mikes horror scope for today's forecast and I would like to read you what it predicted "Nothing much happening today, stay inside, it might rain" *Shrug* I guess they can't be right all the time. Still on a mission to see if I could find something, I decided to check the Chinese zodiac and unsurprisingly he is from in the year of the rooster, considering how cocky he can be I guess it was spot on. </p>
<p>If you have known mike the last few years he has become quite attached to his blankets, he has been known to wonder around a room full of gamers with his beloved blanket, whether this is a step up on the ladder of life is still in debate. I could bore you with stories of our many adventures, including almost being arrested, but I would like to make a few points that I noted over the last few years of mike and Tess's relationship and exactly why opposites attract.</p>
<p>Mike is a quiet analytical man who thinks before he speaks, he is always mind full of your feelings and will be patient with those who do not understand him. Tess is a passionate out spoken young women who is not afraid to speak her mind, she will go far in life.  One ironic point is that, considering their respective heights, Tess has always seemed to have her head in the clouds and mike is a man who sees the ground in front of him... I have always wondered if they will have normal sized children. </p>
<p>Mike I am sure you realise you are going to be spending Saturday afternoons shopping and spending money, Sundays visiting the in-laws and evenings opening bottles for others to drink but you will be spending them with the one you love and I am sure as all can see two people are hopelessly head of heels for each other.  They will, and have, flourished in this time of fast paced lives where if you know your head from you feet, you are doing pretty well.</p>
<p>I have one or two pieces of advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tess, mike wears the pants...mostly</li>
<li>Mike, your mother in law also wears the pants</li>
<li>Be mindful of each other at all times. Never take the other for granted</li>
<li>When you fight, never go to bed angry.</li>
<li>Take one day at a time, the past where you learn your mistakes, the future you can only plan for, but now is the time that counts.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in conclusion, good luck on your new adventure, there will be many challenges to tackle and much fun to be had. I would to ask you all to raise your glasses... To LOVE and LIFE!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ross eloquently tied all the speeches together, resulting in a well-prepared and fun evening. Ross did some other tying together, but we'll leave that for another LJ entry. :)  You go boy!</p>
<h4>In conclusion</h4>
<p>The entire weekend was a hit.  There was much healing and much love.  All in all, a healthy and unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>There's just one thing left to say: Congratulations Mike and Tess on your marriage. You guys are lovely together!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

(Aren't most dreams confusing?)  I don't recall the whole dream, but there were two images that really stuck out.</p>
<p>There was a threat by a snake, inside the house.  Carpetted floor.  I wasn't the only one in the house, so we rallied against the snake.  My comrade managed to grab a spade or panga, and just as he struck down on the snake (to decapitate it) the snake had shape-shifted into a cat.  The blade of the spade severed the front paws. I wasn't particularly shocked, just caught in a moment of amazement.</p>
<p>I was then given a rehash of the event, but this time, as the blade descended, the snake shifted into a tall, middle-aged and hairless man.  The blade cut off his toes.  He didn't wince or show any reaction.  It was like he was inanimate, a specimen, something you'd look in on through a glass window, as if examining.</p>
<p>That's all I could remember that morning.  Any thoughts on the shape shifting?  Or why the toes had to be cut off?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

I'm slipping into a Dimension Data Drone-like rut. I'm starting to miss where I was a few months ago, both mentally and physically.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>An intersection is about choices, a Junction.  Various organisms come together at the intersection.  There is no traffic officer on duty, nor any particular system to the flow of traffic.  Isn't a junction then about clashing? A junction is a meeting-and-then-passing place. I see you, I pass you.  I don't look back.  I have a place to be and you're in my way.</p>
	<p>More bodies into the fray.  Less efficiency.  The only ones smiling are the one who "service" the motorists. Am I learning anything during this stressful and inefficient time?  Is it important to me to know that Nissan have 14.35% market share in personal motor vehicles?  Do I care that you're driving your fucking kids to school while I am trying to get to work?</p>
	<p>I think I've made a mistake coming here.  I've set myself up for disappointment, in much the same way you set high expectations within me, and then crash them down on me.  So the circle continues.  The cycle of a circle.  The circular cycles of circles. Ad infinitum.</p>
	<p>Let there be a lesson here.  When I work out what the principle is, I'll let you know.  In the meantime I need your support and you're not offering it.  If I ask for support, you'll part ways with it, and not give it.  We're all selfish like that.</p>

	<p>Definition of a brainstorm: When the light of an idea isn't followed by a low-grumbling noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't that true for the first stages of an idea, when you share that idea with another?  Sometimes listening to overly negative criticisms for an idea you had, can really flip the idea switch to off.</p>
<p>How does one continue with the creative power of an idea without being disheartened?  Maybe a certain sense of stubbornness is required.  Or self-discipline.  Did the people with great ideas share their ideas?  Did these same people have certain qualities that forced them to pursue their ideas in the face of criticism?</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about how copyrighting, patenting and attaching a monetary value to an idea is slowing our progress as human beings.  Most of this thinking was spurred on by a new colleague, Neil, and <a href="http://nxsy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his quirky blog</a>.</p>
<p>There are exceptions of course when creating and sharing ideas freely.  Initiatives such as open-source are definitely a step in the right direction.  The collaborative nature of the internet too.  And... what about <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this gem that is TED</a>. This very conference has probably spawned a shift in the interfaces surrounding mobile phones, as evident in the iPhone.  If you don't see the link in my thinking... watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKh1Rv0PlOQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this video of Jeff Han demonstrating a hand-operated interface</a> at TED.</p>
<p>Neil's blog also mentions <a href="http://nxsy.org/blog/archives/2007/02/19/pollsmoor-prisoners-write-openicdl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a recent success in teaching prisoners to use open-source software</a>.</p>
<p>It got me thinking that it must take ages to learn how to use a computer, (especially if you're only proficient with a handgun!) and how having to deal with a such things as a keyboard and mouse are taken for granted by us experienced users.</p>
<p>There must be a better way to be productive on a PC than having to learn the ins and outs of an operating system first. How does one avoid having to learn the way input devices interact with this OS before you can even open the application you need? What if I can't read or write!?  Maybe we need to invert the way an OS runs Apps, and make Apps run the OS.  In fact, who needs an OS! (Self-critic activated: That was stretching the idea a bit too far.)</p>
<p>Still, having an intuitive interface should be the way forward.  Vista bollocks! It's still the same old shit, just with new pretty graphics.  Where is the Wii Wand for my input!  Damn, I love <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym>!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">
