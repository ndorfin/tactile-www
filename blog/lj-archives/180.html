		<p>Gareth left for Switzerland on Wednesday for a week - This place subsequently got a lot lonelier.  I've come to know a few of the edocs people but when you're alone, things get a lot colder.  I can't ever imagine going travelling on my own, unless there was a purpose such as cycling from point to point or making a wad-load of money.  Why is that?  I dream of spending such experiences with someone close.  *sigh*</p>
		<p>On Thursday I just decided to go for a walk after returning from work, I took my camera along and just walked.  It was 7 in the evening, but the sun still had another 2 or so hours to go.  What an enriching experience to see aliens go about their afternoon lives, raiding the ice-cream stall, sitting on their patios watching the sun go down.  The squirrels went nuts in their trees, birds frolicked on the immaculate lawns of the average Joe and Jane Smith Residences.</p>
		<p>After another turn off one of the busier roads I was greeted with a sight to make any pleb jealous.  Houses, No, Estates reeking of wealth, sick with wealth, and just behind our hotel.  I was hoping to find a road or path to connect me back to my hotel, but this road wasn't going anywhere except into lucious suburbs.  So I gathered the nerve to ask some of the well-off-locals and boy, did I get an answer.  The one middle-aged cap-wearing sedan-driving doctor-type made it his personal mission to find out if there was a trail leading through the woods to connect me to the hotel road.  Here he was, in the driveway of his own home, and didn't know if the local surrounding forest had any trails in it.  I bet he had never walked up the road of his own blissville. How sad is that?  I guess thats the difference between a have and a have-not.  Americans take a lot for granted.  I guess South Africans do too, but they're different things we forget and neglect.</p>
		<p>So after contemplating the worth of it all and avoiding his waffling about how he'd only been there for 6 months I carried on walking.  This was a walk through increasing budgets, house after house the yards got bigger, the cars parked outside got more expensive.  Finally I bumped into some more people and received some decent directions.  I had to walk accross a field fragrant with summer flowers, 50 meters or so in width, the last border between the wilderness and suburbia.  I felt like Maximus, skimming my palms through the wheat, feeling more alive than ever. The trees formed a tunnel, revealing the trail through.  I felt like I was stepping into a new realm.  My dreams of becoming a bandit in this Sherwood forest were shattered when the trees opened up to become a frikkin parking lot.  An empty concrete wasteland of parking lot.</p>
		<p>I do appreciate the appreciation for nature here, but I can't help but think that man comes selfishly first here. Nature comes a sad second.  Spatterings of reservations, asphalt cleavers splitting the last true residents.  Here on Route 9, 4 lanes of busy New England road, theres a concrete island barrier running most of the length. On the drive back from work one day, I was horrified to see a mother goose and her goslings stranded between the barrier and certain motorised death.</p>
		<p>There are no flies, ants, mosquitos, grasshoppers here. I have no idea what the 3 species of birds feed on. Americans spend about 5 Billion Dollars on pest eradication each year.  (I'm sure you could feed the whole of Africa for that same amount - but that's pointless) I don't know if its climate related or what, but man has taken over here.  A pest in his own right.</p>
		<h3>C'est la vie?</h3>
		<p>Well, this weekend marks a record week for me.  I billed 63 hours in a week.  Last Saturday, Gareth and I made a point of going out and doing some walking through one of the reservations south of Boston: Blue Hills, outside Milton.  We walked about 3-4 miles of some of the most amazing pine forests in New England.  The half-way mark of the walk was an ancient 3-storey observation tower with a panoramic view of Boston and surroundings.  Awe-inspiring.  The oldest weather station in America was to be found just a stones throw away too.  We saw plenty of squirrels including some curious ground based buggers.  The place is a mountain-bikers heaven.</p>
		<p>It was then time to see what the coastal life of southern Boston was like, so we climbed into the hot car and drove towards the atlantic. After a few wrong turns we came accross Marina Bay.  A private and snobby yacht club, masses of Bayliners, this was a miniature Monaco in its own right. So we had a few drinks. (I'm seeing a trend here :D) Thats when the <acronym title="Hallo-Mah-Baby">HMB</acronym>'s emerged, prowling for dollars.  Sure, we had a bit to drink already but we both new, these were real chicks!  After oogling for hours, drinking and watching the sun set we decided to brave the car trip back.  Mixing with snobs is hard work.</p>
		<p>When I got back, I crashed.  Work was due for Sunday :/</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

			All this time, the push for digital, the push away from legacy.  How about digitising your writing?  I always hear that nothing can replace pen and paper, its just a matter of time before people are using stylus's and tablets.  For meetings, I'm already seeing delegates walking in with their laptops, all wireless enabled.  Star Trek anyone? :D

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/7447.html'></a> <h3>A trip into Eccentrica, err, *cough*, Boston</h3>
		<p>Last weekend was a total bum weekend. (sic).  It was the first weekend in a month that we could spend some time in Boston or just lounging around.</p>
		<p>So on Saturday Gareth and I organised to go do <a href="http://www.thefreedomtrail.org" title="Browse.to: The Freedom Trail.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Freedom Trail</a> and see a few sites round Boston.</p>
		<p>We drove through to the closest train stop, about 20 miles from our hotel.  The parking lot was PACKED, and after spending 30 minutes and 3.5 dollars queuing we were on the Green-Line 'T' headed for Boston.  The little subway coach was jam-packed with Red Sox supporters on their way to Fenway Park. Imagine that hey?  Getting on a train to go see a sporting event?  The mind boggles.  After dropping the baseball fanatics off at about the 8<sup>th</sup> stop and descending into the subways, we got off 3 stops or so later in Park St. Station.  When we emerged into the sunlight we were greeted with some interesting and downright disgusting sights.</p>
		<p>The first thing I saw ascending from the subway was a church steeple (Park St. Church) in the throes of restoration. Imagine heritage, imagine intended rejuvenation, scaffolding and all. Now imagine there are monkeys doing the restoration.  That pretty much sums Boston up, except a high percentage of church go-ers are 'eccentric' and anything but straight.</p>
		<p>This weekend is the Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in Boston, so that explained all the 'eccentrics' in the streets.  'Men' holding hands, in G-strings.  How Cute.  In an attempt to get my head clear of the awful images I focused on my juicy hotdog. (err, no wait.)  Yeah, we decided to start the freedom trail.</p>
		<p>2 and half miles of walking along some of the oldest and most significant buildings in Boston's history. <a href="http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/tour.htm" title="Browse.to: The Trail, a virtual tour" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This</a> will give you an idea of what we saw along the way.</p>
		<p>Oddly enough, half the exhibits closed at 4PM, so we didn't arrive in time to board the USS Constitution or one of the docked destroyers. It was at about 6PM when we arrived at the Boston Aquarium to see it closed too.  So we had a few beers.</p>
		<p>We found out that there were some great clubs just down the road from Fenway Park (Home of the Red Sox remember?) and that the Red Sox had just had their asses handed to them on a plate by LA. So we got back on the subway.  After a few more beers in Tiki Room and viewing the non-existent hotties we decided it was time for something to eat.  Just off Massachusetts Avenue was a road of utter class (now if only I could remember the name). Restaurant after Ristorante, reeking of dollars. So like drunken bums we crashed the T.G.I. Friday's and enjoyed a hearty meal. (TGI Fridays is a restaurant / pub chain in America, similar to Keg's.)</p>
		<p>Sunday we slept in late.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The people of Boston were always inclined to control their own affairs. It was here, after all, that Puritans first came to establish religious independence [...] It was a good plan, in theory - but Boston colonists were having none of it. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no voice, no vote in matters that concerned their essential liberties.</p>
			<p>-- Boston is certainly undergoing another "revolution".  It's not race related, nor is it religious.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>For those not-in-the-know, I've uploaded a whole bunch of photos to <a href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/" title="Browse.to: BotoPhu, err, PhotoBucket.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PhotoBucket.com</a>.  Photobucket automatically compresses each image to 250k or less.  Not great, but not bad either.  I'll upload the pics from Boston soon.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/7354.html'></a> <h3>Long time no update</h3>
	<p>10 days is plenty enough time.  In 10 days nations were conquered, seeds ripened, people change.</p>
	<p>Just come back from the local pub, feeling like drunken laddies after a few pints with the mates.</p>
	<p>Work has been an all-consuming all-powerful entity in my life, like a drug addiction. Its like my whole life-force is centered around it.  What do you have to show after working so hard? Beside personal vindication and maybe some extra cash in your back pocket you've literally wasted yourslef away doing something seemingly worthless.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Whats the difference between and porsche and a porcupine?</p>
			<p>With a porcupine, the pricks are on the outside.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<p>So, I started gymming.  Something I've abhored for many years thinking gym is for jocks and self-centered pricks.  Granted there are many pricks that do gym, but it made me realise just how unfit I really am.  I remember at school PE periods being able to easily do 10 pull-ups and outgunning the rugby tossers who packed on so much weight they could barely do one pull-up.  Now I can barely do one - that will change.</p>
	<p>Having Gareth around is great motivation.  We spend about 3 days a week at the local Gold's Gym with our complimentary tickets doing some aerobic and weight training.  I feel like such a weed at times, barely being able to bench-press 20 kilograms in 15 sets.  But then I think about how I was such a n00b at Tribes 2, and that with persistence even the greenest of n00bs can become flybois. :D  This one is for you Jian :)</p>
	<p>So, its been focusing on the week, eating well, gymming often and having a positive outlook on life.</p>
	<p>Work has been total crap actually.  I successfully managed to step on the head-UI-developer's toes by suggesting an update to his IDK with my new markup example. Well, I thought I'd never seen pride in the office but this guy was just not interested in any improvements to his little project.  So be it ignoramus - - your loss. Now I'm slaying bugs, a great warrior with shiny silver armour and a maiden to rescue.  Granted, she's a tired old wench but she puts out better than those skanky londonium whores.  Together, Patriot and I have seen the four corners of the earth, stared death in its hollow face and cut his nose off with a giant cleaver.  Fear me.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, I'm looking forward to a weekend spent in Boston for the first time since arriving here.  We've sorta planned to go visit <a href="http://www.sixflags.com" title="Browse.to: Six Flags" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Six Flags New England</a> and maybe go catch a Red Sox game.  The countryside around here is amazing, just pine, spruce and maple forests for as long as the eye can see.  Definately worth a sojourn or two.</p>
	<h3>The trip to New York City</h3>
	<p>So we decided to go see one of Gareth's friends in Queens, New York, New York.  After 3-4 hours driving we arrived and were toally lost.  New York is HUGE. Gareth's friend Gareth Gareth was drunk when we approached NYC, the very man to give us directions.  I just laughed.</p>
	<p>After 1 aand half hours of driving in circles we managed to reach our intended destination, Gareth was getting tense.  I just smiled.</p>
	<p>So we had a few beers, and Gareth had a few more.  I was merry enough to still have my wits about me when it was time to leave for a good-nights-sleep.  There we were, 5 of us, limping and laughing back home, feeling tired after a day of work and driving. On our way home we learnt of the quality of street-shopping, as many new yorkers throw stuff out onto the street that is worth quite a bit of tom.  Low and behold, a king-size mattress was on our route, to any half-drunk person yearning for a few zees it was manna from heaven.  But there had to be a reason it was out on the street.</p>
	<p>The next morning we woke to tea, cereal and an itenerary any newcomer to new york would plan. We took the subway to Grand Central station and amazed ourselves under the huge dome.  Truly grand.  I spent about 10 minutes in a sports-store (10 minutes is a lot for a man in any store) looking for a hockey jersey for Neill (oops, did I mention Neill? My bad! :D) From there we walked through to Times Square and some jaw-dropping times.  Times Square is amazing, the hub of New York, its almagamtion of culture and melting pot of races.  After a few photos and seeing the steaming cup of noodles we walked up to the Empire State Building.</p>
	<p>An hour spent in queues is quite good for the Empire State Building.  It was an overcast day, but our fears of poor visibility were put aside when we reached the top to see a panaroma of concrete and steel. Visibility was 15 miles, enough to see all the rivers on all sides and the many bridges that spanned them.  No cent is spared in America when it comes to hurdling an obstacle such as a 200m wide river.  After many happy snaps and feeling like a total tourist we left for an epic pub-crawling-adventure the likes of which I'd never imagined.  In the end we were stopping off at pubs just to take a leak and therefore have another beer.  I felt like one of the manne.  After a stop-off at one of the more dodgy strip-clubs and walking for miles to get something to eat our journey truly ended when we met up with the girls and a few other mates to go have an evening in the Gotham Comedy Club.  A select set of comedians were presnting a stand-up dig in front of a select group of people, and we were invited.  For some reason, these guys and gals were actually funny! (This week, I noticed 2 of the comedians on TV - these are not small time comics). We lef the show with sore stomach muscles and grins imprinted on our faces.</p>
	<p>After sleeping in a bit the next morning, overcoming the tenderness perpetrated by a drinking hang-over, we set off for Paragon Sports, the biggest sports store I've ever seen. (A recurring theme here folks, everything here in the States is just bigger and better than anywhere else).  Gareth bought some fancy new climbing boots for his trip to the Andes at the end of the year.</p>
	<p>On our return joruney we stopped off at a Denny's and finally had a semi-decent restaurant meal.  Avoid McDonalds and Burger King - nasty stuff.</p>
	<h3>10 days later?</h3>
	<p>Gareth is still scratching at his bed-bug-bites from that infested mattress.  Theres a lesson here: If someone throws a mattress onto the street in New York, and in your drunken state you want to use it, forget it.  Gareth looks like he's got hives its so bad.  I still laugh.</p>
	<p>Till the next update. I'm so tired I'm squinting.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A traveller.</p>
		<p>Feet blistered from many a mile, face scorched from sunshine.  To know the road is to know yourself.  Out here in the blistering heat you only have your own mind to talk to, its like a drunken brawl trying to persuade your psyche to wake up and see the tar for what it is, black, lifeless, something beneath your feet. Yet you plod on, left right, links regs.  The travelling is not about the pacing towards the end of the road, its about seeing everything on the way and learning about it.  Learning more about yourself.</p>
		<p>The weather can be harsh, or pleasant.  The road can be steep, or flat.  (Steep represents downhill too.)  Each step is a step forward, a journey each one of us should take, often neglected.</p>
		<p>An oracle.</p>

		<h3>Uncle George's place</h3>
		<p>Gareth and I took a drive down to Wsahington DC early on saturday morning.  It took us 8 hours to drive 666 kilometers.</p>
		<p>We passed through such amazing cities as New York, Newark, Baltimore, Philedelphia.  New York is a lot bigger than you think.  From the Bronx, we took the I-95S around the northern parts of New York and saw the manhattan skyline on the horizon, on a beautiful spring day.</p>
		<p>Mind blowing size, bulging budgets and a great appreciation for rock.  America is the home of rock, you flip thru radio channels and are greeted with the sweet tones of Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster Cult, Lost Prophets, Metallica.  If there was another reason for me to move to the US, it would be for the music.</p>
		<p>The american road driving experience is an interesting one, especially when you get pulled over by a sweaty-state-police-pig after doing 83 in a 65 zone.  $180 is way too much apparently.  Phew.  But that set a tone for the driving, chilled 75 miles an hour with everyone else on the road.  At most of the overhanging bridges american flags flapped againt the railings, multitudes of flags of all sizes.  Trucks keep up to the speed limit and everyone just cruises along, as if all attached by cables.  I have never seen so many different types of cars before, all burning clean fuel with little or no visible emissions.  Trucks the sizes of football fields, shining chrome in immaculate condition.</p>
		<h3>In the prideland</h3>
		<p>Our timing couldn't have been better.</p>
		<p>It was memorial day weekend.  A time to remmeber fallen soldiers fighting for america's right to have war when they wanted.</p>
		<p>It was also <acronym title="Harley Owners Group">HOG</acronym> weekend, close to 10 000 Harley Davidsons were in Washington, as many veterans pursue the passion of comradery on their steel horses. "Rolling Thunder" is really the only phrase to descibe a thousand harleys dragging up the main streets in Washington.</p>
		<p>Every year, around this time of the year the indigenous cicadas emerge from 17 years of slumber and pupation.  In an eerie forest born chorus they entice mates and intrigue the locals.  While it does remind you a lot of the bush in SA, it seems as foregin as this country is.</p>
		<h3>Bliss, this is.</h3>
		<p>Our hosts, Chris and Heidi are an amazing couple.  Heidi is a part-swiss-part-barbadian-all-american-e<wbr />conomist and Chris is a cardiologist with a great appreciation for life.  They recently moved into a beautiful apartment in a "transition-neighbourhood" in north western washington.</p>
		<p>We arrived at about 4PM, so Chris decided we should walk through the Rock Creek Park which literally divides Washington DC in half.  It was mind-blowing walking through an all-nautral forest in the middle of a huge city.  We finished off our walk with a beers in Georgetown, then stumbled down to the Potomac river to see Virginia, some of the local wild-life (SA girls still rock) then caught a cab back to Heidi's and Chris' place. When we arrived, Heidi had been preparing a wonderful meal.  Tilapia, served with a white-wine, brown-sugar and garlic topping with a side of nutty-greco salad.  Such an awesome meal topped off with hot apple pie and melting ice-cream.  I was literally dozing off, but the old farts had enough steam to go out partying till 3AM, visiting a jazz club and knocking back a few bourbons and <acronym title="Gin and Tonics">G&amp;T's</acronym> for $6 each.  I fell asleep to honking hispanics and birds chirping in the faux-day provided by the street lights.</p>
		<p>The next morning we cycled everywhere!  Chris took us for sojourns through the Mall area of Washington, we saw all the memorials we could, visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt memorial which left us totally gob-smacked.  We spent about 3 hours totally oogling at the Natural History Museum and grabbing a bite to eat.  Then we went to an olde american restaurant called the Chophouse and Brewery and had some home-brewed dark ales.  When we got back home, Heidi had been industrios in the kitchen again.  I felt guilty for some reason, Heidi went through a lot of trouble to accommodate us and our stomachs.  Kudos!</p>
		<p>Chris has an awesome taste in music, so while chillin' to some kewl tunes and flipping thru photos it was soon time for bed again.</p>
		<p>The next morning, we were back on our bikes again and headed down to the Botanic Gardens.  There was another veterans parade, consisting of few authentic jeeps, bikes, <acronym title="Armored Personnel Carriers">APC's</acronym> and even amphibious vehicles.  The botanical gardens were mind-blowing.  All the plants were flowering with health, so much so, we spent about half-an-hour in the Orchid area. It doesn't get better than that.</p>
		<h3>Back to Boston</h3>
		<p>We're now on our way back to Boston stuck in traffic after the long weekend yet revelling in the awesome times we had over the last 72 hours.</p>
		<p>A few thoughts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chris and Heidi are so in love it was beautiful.  Adoration in the eyes, respect in the mind.</li>
			<li>Americans are truly patriotic, almost bordering on fundamentalism.</li>
			<li>Frankling D. Roosevelt was and is an amazing man.</li>
			<li>Washington was a lot less clinical than I thought it would be.</li>
			<li>Gareth has some amazing friends.</li>

<p>Phew, a much needed update.  I'll try seperate it where possible.  Downloading T2 in the background to play on my flashy new edocs supplied laptop :D</p>
<h3>8000ish miles to go....</h3>
<p>Welcome to South Africa, or rather, you'll remember us when you're gone, if you can get out. In typical South African fashion inefficiency reeks in the customs department.  I queued for 30 mins after checking in baggage, sorry for you if you're slightly late.  8 cubicles manned by one seriously old man and 2 women.  The international visitors now departing our wonderfully useless country are left with a bitter taste in their mouths.  We waited in the business class lounge just long enough to finish a free beer or two and chat to the other snobs.  Anyway, that was all before 7PM on thursday night (20<sup>th</sup>).  After the last boarding queue, we had to step outside and get on a bus.  The bus waited for a good 5 minutes before we almost collapsed from breathing in too much diesel.  The cranky internationals were now getting vocal about the bad service.  Gareth and I just grinned and beared it like South Africans I guess.</p>
<p>And that was that, we turned our backs on Jozy and boarded the shiny new SAA Airbus A340 600.  This plane was the shit!  Naturally it was 100 times better in business class.  The seats were incredibly comfortable even after 11 hours of flying.  Theres a retractable and adjustable light just above your right shoulder.  A 13" monitor folds neatly out of your right armrest.  On the left you've got your tray which folds into the armrest too, and the controls for the chairs just below it.  Yes, electric motors to adjust your seat.  I felt like a true rich bastid.  After take off, one of the Air Stewarts (Not stewards, Gareth and I joked about how all the male flight attendants are queens) or flight attendants come by, set up your tray table with a table cloth, pass you a heated towel (what the hell?) and ask you what you want for supper.  Gareth ordered the merlot and the cute air-hostess that served him.  I had the seasonal salad and skipped on the air-hostess.  She was all bitchy and stuff. I ordered the fillet and a few beers, oh my, melt-in-the-mouth beef, garlic rolls and good beer.  Once supper was trying to settle it was DVD time!  Mystic River, Along Came Polly to name a few and on the circuit they had Frasier (amongst others) which was good.  Next thing I know Gareth has passed out from too much wine and I'm fading fast too.  Didn't sleep well but within no time we were greeted with a traditional south african breakfast followed by our descent into Frankfurt.</p>
<h3>What am I doing here?</h3>
<p>Let me just state categorically that Frankfurt is a terrible airport.  Imagine a socialist / industrialist setting, 70's style abuse of metal with no taste for interiors, whiffs of cigarette smoke on the fan.  For 4 hours we abused the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge's coffee supply and biscuits.  German males are an interesting crossbreed of up-and-coming east-randers and intellectual businessmen. Women, like the men. (harsh? :D) Paging thru german magazines is like reading a user-manual for a complicated household appliance. Lets just say, its 4 hours of my life spent in total fascination in the clothing styles of the germans, daziness and that feeling you're sleeping with your eyes open.  Now, boarding was a breeze.  South Africa, take note, they might have bad taste, but they're orderly.  They even have automated toilet seat cleaners. Pity about the US customs, removing shoes, getting felt up by the sweaty german guards.</p>
<h3>Following Columbus, sorta.</h3>
<p>This time we boarded a Lufthansa Airbus A340 200, an older model, with older decor.  Gareth and I agreed that business class on that flight was like economy class on SAA.  (Hmm, maybe we are becoming snobs - All it takes is one flight in business class and everything else pales in comparison)  At this stage I've got a sore stomach from being so lethargic for the last 15 hours.  Not pleasant.  At least our air hostess was more accommodating. The food was better.  8 hours later and we touched down to a beautiful spring day in Boston.</p>
<h3>The U.S. of A, after a day.</h3>
<p>After filling out all the paperwork, being interviewed again and fingerprinted we were in the US!  Avis sent a bus over to come pick us up.  (I'm still trying to get used to their weird sense of styles in motor vehicles.)  After arguing with their sales rep and watching Gareth's credit card bounce we finally picked up a Ford Freestar "mini-van" (pretty similar to a Chrysler Voyager) and tried to navigate the maze of highways and routes out of Logan Internationl into Natick. All I can say is WOW.  I've never seen so many leafy green maples in my life before.  The Boston Reseroirs are all full, giving the area a calm lake district feel.  There are no flies or gnats, plenty of sparrows and crows and these amazing trees.  Drunken with fatigue we actually made it thru to the offices there and introduced ourselves around (nuts?).  On the way home we picked up some pre-paid sim cards from T-Mobile (bad choice in the end, we have to pay for all incoming calls and the coverage is useless! Americans are so backwards when it comes to cellphones)  Then we actually made it thru to the <a href="http://www.sierrasuites.com/locations/westborough.asp" title="Browse.to: Sierra Suites Westborough" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">suites in Westborough</a>.  Boston to Natick: 50 miles.  Natick to Westboroguh: 10 miles. It felt far too long. I unpacked and crashed.</p>
<h3>The first saturday</h3>
<p>Woke up about 4 times during the night and then got up at about 9.  We did some much needed shopping.  Um, food?  We stopped by a um, Super Stop &amp; Shop, similar to a Pick and Pay.  The first isle was whacked.  We found muesli and soups and stuff, but my word it was expensive.  We frowned upon the lack of cereals.  Then we found the other isles. FOOD!  They had one isle dedicated to cereals.  Heart Attack flavour, High Cholestorol flavour, Guilt with a smile flavour.  My word, FOOOOOOD!  Interestingly enough, all the healthy stuff was like double the price, wholewheat bread is like rye bread and twice the price of white bread.  If the american government wanted to cure obesity, I reckon they should tax all the bad-for-you stuff and lift the taxes on the good-for-you stuff. :D  After buying some authentic american ice cream and the usual stuff we were out of there. It takes a while to get used to driving in the USA, especially if there are no cars around.  Gareth almost slipped up once, driving down the wrong side of the road.  Then got a chance to catch up on more sleep and check what the suites had to offer.  Kitchenette, bathroom, couch and double bed each.  What more could a bachelor want? Oh, wireless internet access, room service and a TV thats what. Saturday's supper was spent at a local friendlies, a kiddies restaurant.  Don't ask. :D  The best chocolate shake I've ever tasted and a toasted chicken sandwich from hell, it rocked.</p>
<h3>Sleepy Sunday</h3>
<p>Sunday was true <acronym title="Rest and Relaxation">R&amp;R</acronym>, lazing around, reading, watching TV.  That evening we took a walk thru to the local pub and learnt that baseball is an OK game, and not all americans are rude and arrogant. :P  Their beers suck though.  We'll make plans to go check out the Redsox kick more ass sometime.  Ice Hockey and Football are not happening round this time of the year, so we won't be able to see them in action.  Dunno about Basketball.</p>
<h3>Welcome to Corporate America.</h3>
<p>"Office space" and "Dead like me" come to mind when describing edocs' offices.  Cubicles, water machines, some irriating types, but wait, they have FREE vending machines with snacks and sodas.  Sekz!  They have this weird coffee machine that you put a special filter cup into place and it sorts you out.  edocs had arranged two brand spanking new Dell Latitude D600's for gareth and I, with everything installed.  Efficiency!  Everything just works here, no failed traffic lights, bad networking etc.  Wireless pwns, No hassles networking. Anyway, Gareth and I are gonna be working on a dog-ugly project, fixing bugs and adding improvements where possible.  Home from home :D</p>
<h3>Back to the usual</h3>
<p>Its now the end of day 4, and we're settling into a routine.  I've arranged with Gareth to go to the local gym and work on a fitness reginme. 2 months is more than enough time to see results, especially with such a motivated fitness fanatic watching my progress.  Watch this space.</p>
<p>I'm going to try arrange a rental mountain bike and investigate the local woodlands with my awesome little camera. Anton should hopefully be setting up the Consology Vhost for me, so I can stick up a whole lot of photos soon.</p>

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/6317.html'></a> <h3>It's been a while (Staind say it best)</h3>
		<p>So the laptop is well, on my lap again and the CD is making a hectic buzz, its like a vibrator *hubba hubba*.</p>
		<p>Just came back from an awesome supper with our resident grey-kop, Katarn.  Time spent with a friend is time well spent.  Katarn and I can talk about some of the deepest shit around which is quite refreshing.  And we weren't even stoned. :)</p>
		<p>In chatting about blogging, it got me thinking as to why I started blogging in the first place.  I admit, its nice being talked about or being passed compliments, but the thing driving me the most to blog was a feeling of experimentation.  To explore avenues in myself and others.  Its been good.</p>
		<p>So I've been told that a lot of of the stuff I write about comes accross as being feminine.  I think our fairer sex still has a lot to teach us guys, when you think of compassion, which sex do you think of?  When you think of greed, or arrogance, which sex do you think of?  Off the cuff, I'm not gay.  (So shoo Anthrax!) :D  But as a free thinking person, I think there is much value in trying not to be such a man.  I'm an emotional person, why should I reserve something so intricate?</p>
		<p>OK, now this vibrating laptop is getting frikkin irritating.</p>
		<p>Another thing that I found interesting recently and totally agree with, is that your best work is when you just do something cos you're passionate about it. Pay someone to do something and it just won't be the same, it'll be forced, passionless.  Look at artists and authors.  I reckon some artists create their best pieces when they're broke-ass or depressed.  Say you'll pay them for their next piece and it just won't be the same person behind the brush.  When last did you do somnething totally selfless?</p>
		<blockquote><p>The difference between madness and eccentricity is the size of the wallet.</p></blockquote>
		<h3>Wholeness vs Holeness</h3>
		<p>I've been told before that searching for a relationship to make you complete is unhealthy and the wrong attitude towards a relationship.  Take the circle analogy.  You want to be a complete circle.  You're half a circle.  You want your other half to become whole.  Thats bad right?</p>
		<p>I got a different perspective to this analogy from a very special neighbour while she was on an exchange program in France.  She reckons rather you should be a complete circle yourself first.  You're a small circle, but you're still complete.  When you meet this other small full circle, you create a bigger circle, like two bubbles in a soapy mingling, you become one another and something more.</p>
		<p>But now I don't know.  I know I'm at my most happy when I make others happy.  They do complete me first.  I'm a goat.  If I'm not satisfying my soulmate, I'm just not satisfied.  Maybe I am half a circle, yearning to be more complete, but when the two halves meet, we become more than what two halves create.  Its the space between that expands inside us, like a mixing of gases with an explosive reaction, with us shielding it, absorbing it.  I think you're truly whole when you know how to love.  Whats wrong with wanting someone to complete you?  What greater sacrifice that offering yourself to someone else completely?</p>

		<h3>Update on the travel plans</h3>
		<p>Thursday, 7pm.  Finally, a date and a time to plan my life around.  Gareth and I'll be flying business class to Frankfurt and then Boston in a marathon 19 hours over 8500 miles.  Business class, I believe, is the shiznit!  We'll be flying SAA in the new Airbus A340's.  This my friends, is as good as it gets.  Did I mention I'm stoked? :D</p>
		<p>We'll be staying in the Sierra Suites in Westborough, MA.  At $80 a night with breakfast included, its amazing too see just how insignificant the rand and my thoughts on spending are.  The plane tickets are gonna cost $5k, return.  We get a car for our uses.  Words fail me, literally?  My gut reaction right now, is to work my ass off and make it totally worth edocs and consology's time and money.  And have a great time doing so.</p>
		<p>Gareth has plans to drink lots, meet plenty of people, hike Vermont flat, visit New York.  I have plans to tag along as much as possible :D  Other than that, see all those things you never get a chance to, such as going to see Linkin Park, KoRn, Incubus, tour Harvard and walk Boston flat.  Part of me wants to sit down with an american over coffee and just talk. (I hope she'll be cute :D)  See what life is like on the other side.  *conjures up plans to ask out someone within edocs*  *plans crushed*  *conjures up just going to stacks of clubs and pubs* *smiles*</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Getting into the US has changed a lot since last I went.  Now, VISA applications have a mandatory interview session.</p>
		<p>Your application has to include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your current employer's letter of appointment</li>
			<li>A letter from your contractor in the US explaining why you're needed in the US</li>
			<li>6 months worth of payslips</li>
			<li>3 months worth of bank statements</li>
			<li>Any lease information with regards to your current residence</li>
			<li>3 2"x2" colour photos</li>
			<li>... and R720</li>
			<li>Dare I say: Penis measurements?  Who knows what happens in these sessions!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>At first, the only available interview appointment date was the 7th of June.  People die and get buried in under a weeks time, yet to book an interview is going to take 3 weeks?!  Talk about beareaucracy!  Its all artificial security IMO.</p>
		<p>On top of that, I've been trying to apply for internet banking.  4 days later, it might actually work.  I've faxed branches with updated personal details, shown them my new ID number, phoned their call center 3 times.  Wow.  Customer Service in this country rocks, but we all know that already.</p>
		<h3>In other news...</h3>
		<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.blogger.com" title="Browse.to: Blogger.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blogger</a> are really pulling up their socks.  Rock on adaptive path! Guess I should finally put more work into my blogspot blog.</p>
		<h3>This entry dedicated to...</h3>
		<p>...someone you don't know.  You rock poo.  I posted about wholesome people, wondering where they are, and there she is, right under my nose. (She is kinda short :P)</p>
		<blockquote><p>I want the best for her, I want to see her excell, I want her to smile.  Oh boy can she smile, she makes me tickle inside :)  She is natural, beautifully timid like a wild deer.  I think she's trapped in her mind though, and it hurts me to see her that way.  I want to take a can opener and peel away the now hardened tin shell, exposing the wonderfulness inside.  I know its there, there are hints.  She goes thru life, saying shes happy, but I know she hurts.  I want to comfort her.  I want to be her bastion of security.  Open your eyes!</p></blockquote>
		<p>Now its eating me up that I have to leave her nameless.  I'd happily tell the world how much I love her, but thats not fair on her.  I don't think she feels the same way about me.   I've always gone thru life like that, totally devoted to someone who wouldn't even think the same about me.  I think its great, but it hurts at times.</p>
		<p>Anyway, did some reading into chinese astrology. Turns out I'm a goat.  After reading the description I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fits me.  A cancerian goat.  A cancerian goat moon child.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I wish I was the sk8r boi, but I don't want Avril Lavigne, she's wrong.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		<p>My place of serenity is only a place that I know of.  Its an aura of love, love from the earth itself.  I feel complete in the speckled shadows of its life-giving branches.  When I run through the shadows, the sun flashes between the leaves, in that moment, I am alive. All around, there is a glow of peace, fulfillment.</p>
		<p>I could play in the tree all day, swinging from overhangs upside down and never fear falling, cos here you just float.  At night you can lie in the bows, head resting against the trunk and listen to the marsupial folk go about their nocturnal playfulness.  You don't need sleep here cos you're constantly dreaming.  Sometimes it feels like this is the only tree in the jungle and I wonder if my tree is lonely.  With a trunk so strong and leaves bristling with vitality its evident that all is well.</p>
		<p>Everyday our two trees move closer together.  The branches reach out to the sun, and one another.  Two steeples of security, with arms encircling.  I play in my tree, you in yours.  We don't notice the closing of the distance.  Our trees see the value in that closeness, yet we're too distracted feeling gees swinging from the branches.  For the first time, our eyes cross.  You're shy yet playful.  I'm totally curious.  I chase you thru the branches, you enjoy the attention.  Pretty soon, I'm not even in my own tree anymore.  But my tree is not mine, its ours.  I'm clambering up what used to be yours.  Its great, I'm beaming from ear to ear!  The trees are smiling too, because in this moment, everything is perfect.</p>

<p>Eat your hearts out, I'm gonna be as far away from the 3rd world as I am a socialite.</p>
<p>Yep, 3 whole frikkin months in Boston, MA, on a skills exchange of sorts.  Starting within the week.  Our tech partner <a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: edocs.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">eDocs</a> has requested 2 of us from the office, and specifically mentioned my name!  I've

got to teach a few of them Web Standards, Markup, CSS, while they train the two of us in some new products and J2EE Struts / Tiles.  I can't wait

:D</p>
<p>We (Gareth - total party machine) are set to leave on the 17th.  We'll have a car with unlimited mileage at our disposal, and a company rented

house in an upmarket suburb, 5 miles from edoc's head office in Natick.  Travel Subsidy and the usual SA salary. \o/</p>
<p>Linkin Park, Incubus, Jewel, Sarah Maclachlan, Dave Matthews Band are all going to be performing in the greater Boston area over the time period.

Rock on, its gonna be such an awesome experience moshing with americans.  I'm also making plans to visit the Tribal Wars LAN in virginia and play

tribes with some of the best players in the world.  Be very jealous right now fellow gamer. :)  I'll just have to buy a new Area51m Laptop from <a href="http://www.alienware.com" title="Browse.to: Alienware.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alienware</a> first :P</p>
<p>In the meantime I'm trying to organise my whole life around this thing - phew.  Visas, Banking, Tax, International drivers license, the question of

renting, My car, clothes shopping, eish, its all catching up with me.  Most of that all comes second to working overseas for 3 WHOLE MONTHS! :)</p>

AIDS is there to remove you from the face of my planet, get off now please.  Sex is the ultimate expression of your love for someone, if you don't love them, you don't deserve it.  Plain and simple.  To shag is to be a base primate, without thoughtlessness.  You're fulfilling a primeval instinct, common in jocks.  We've been gifted with thoughtfulness, what better mental and emotional experience to be that close to someone you truly love.

With so many other guys my age, and gamers, we don't really create chances to meet new people outside of the gaming social circle.

I can't save all these helpless souls by myself and I'm cross with myself because of it.  Suddenly the sharp realisation hits me with a dull thud, thor's hammer: they don't want to be saved, they like their obscured vision beneath the miniscus created on their faces.  They like the asphyxiation, they're all cheap druggies.  If they chose to drown, should I pull them out?  Is it selfish of me to think like that? FUCK, I can't let this continue. I pull the closest head out the water, but the stare is vacant, this is not a person.  Suddenly I'm pinned under a few of the zombies, they're trying to pull me under. I resist, cos I have to.  Everything I stand for, exists in the air above. In a great explosion of zealous power, I erupt from below, shooting out the water like a freak spout of divine energy.  Blinded by the light, the mindless ones cower in sheer fear, there fixations are replaced with cold-hard-reality.  They didn't think it possible, no one can escape.  But I'm free.  Free of all that conciouslessness.</p></blockquote><br /><p>So, 45 minutes left eh?   Bugger that, I'm off to bed.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>In the holy quest for extrovertedness, I've picked up a nasty inclination towards total arrogance, selfishness.  Empathy *is* an introverted emotion.  I hurt Carla's feelings and I didn't even think twice about it.  There is much value in just listening and not talking your kop off.  :(</p>

<p>Fuck this soap opera that is Tribes. There is so much bad blood everywhere, it must look like a 3rd world slaughter house.  Is it possible to start anew?  I'd like to think so, but there will always be this obscured vision.  Its so petty too, we had a great thing once, now its all fucked.  Is that the price for going to far with the community spirit?  Should there be a layer of anonymity (sp?) instead of getting too personal?  The day I think things changed was when people didn't care anymore.  Training stopped, people didn't post interesting news on the forums.  We got involved in competition for Team ZA, people played to win.  Playing to win is great, but then everyone else must play to win and not whine about being thrashed.  Winning is fun.  CHKNHD left. Downhill from there.  Attitudes veered off the road like taxi drivers over christmas.  Last straw: Cheating.  Such a great community down the tubes.   Another problem Tribes had was lack of critical mass.  (x amount of players per night, we were x-10.)  We have a golden opportunity with Tribes Vengeance to get critical mass.  HL2 is delayed.  Roll on Vengeance.  Will our community spirit be back with a vengeance though? *cough*</p>

Sure, its sekzy and stuff, but another  capitalist plot like christmas.  Maybe I'm just bitter cos I didn't see any cleavage today :P &lt;/perv&gt;</p><br /><h3>Archive THIS!</h3><br /><p>I thought I'd stick some old stuff I wrote a while back in here...</p><br /><blockquote><p>Who do i turn to?  Who can I say loves me?  Who can I say I love?<br />who dares take me for what I am?  I cant even turn to my own mother for that.  why?  cos that person who DEMANDS my love.<br />Who will take me in under their wing, show me affection, hold me tight?  Whisper in my ear, drive me crazy.<br />Who can I call someone significant?</p><br /><p>Who is willing to take that leap of faith, see me for who I am underneath it all?  Anyone can I guess, i just have to lower my  shields.  Once inside, you're safe too.  My security is your security.  My faith is your love.  My trust is your sanctuary.</p><br /><p>All the dangers shielded, we can get on with knowing each other to the core, to the very essence that defines us as human beings.   CONCIOUSNESS.  KNOWING WE'RE CONCIOUS!</p><br /><p>Giving is powerful.  its the harbour shielding the vessels from the great blue harm.  its the promise of rain after a dry <br />summer.  you give me something that makes me wish it was more.  makes me wish it was more than just a friendship thing, makes me  wish it was that way.  while i do value what we have, i want more.  I want you.  I want to love you and you love me back.  Is that  too much?  Im sick of second guessing myself, i want to open myself up to you, share my thoughts, passion.  i want you to open up to  me too, tell me what scares you so that I may comfort you.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>Im locked up, no key to the door. the prison is somewhere in the expanse between friendship and love.  the gatewarden  is a selfish prick.  Im not allowed to see the sun, feel its warmth on my white skin.  I cant even look twice at the female inmates.   when i shower, its got to be to stay clean, not relax.  i'm not allowed to enjoy it, cos its cold outside and the water is colder,  they must run it thru a fridge first, just to spite the inmates and laugh at their shrinking dicks.<br />the other inmates dont seem to notice where they are, why they got there, or even bother to think of a way to get out.  the prison  is located on a great spire, it stretches too high for a man to survive a fall into the warm waters below.  we know its warm cos it  cant be as cold as it is in here.</p><br /><p>then she walks past my cage.  the sun shines indoors for her.  she looks my way the way she does everyday and waves hello.  its  torment, how can she be so kind in a place so cold?  can't she see im hurting?  does she know she's even here?  IS SHE HERE?  She  brings both grief and happiness to my world, like the taste of sweet liquer, it feels great but removes my conciousness, my  self-control.  my self worth.</p><br /><p>Wait, she's waving to the next inmate too!  How can she!  She's meant to wave to me only!  HOW CRUEL!<br />I cant tell her that shes my everything.  Thats unfair right?  I think its unfair to bottle up something so beautiful.  I dont care  really how she's feel about it.  Knowing someone out there feels that way about me would be a KICKASS feeling!  But what if I didnt  like them?  Ouch.  needle pinches as it enters.  It delivers its payload and Im subdued again.  fuck these drugs.  You cant go to  rehab for this.</p><br /><p>I just want to jump from the prison windows.  I would live for the rush, knowing ive escaped.  I would die in the hands of the  warmth.  I would die happy.  I want her to jump with me.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>I take you in my hands, you fit snug, more snug than my own hand.  it feels good.  nothing can replace that feeling,  that your sense of touch is provoked, aroused by someone else.  no longer is it you sending a echoing relay of impulse, but an  external source reaching out for reciprocation.  I stroke, ploughing your fertile earth with sharp steel.  the earth is turned over,  rejuvenated.  then you touch me back, it sparks my internal engine into life.  goddamn, this sounds too pornoish.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>So, here we all are, mulling on, again.  I look at my hands, my tendons and veins show from below.  when they look so  scaly, so boney, does that mean they are not capable of love.  i had such a vivid dream, there we were, out in the open, free  countryside, just her and I.  i liked her.  it was the kissing, nothing more, except that closeness.  it wasnt about sex, it wasnt  about the prelude to sex, it was just that moment.  my lips mingled with hers.  i feel her breathe inside me and i in her.  we are  at our most honest.  im totally focused on her, giving her my all.  then he comes along, and wants to chase us out of the potato  plantation.  its not even his frikkin plantation.  he was watching us as well.  what a freak!.<br />but i think back about the closeness, and its all worth it.  i ignore him.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>ahh, to retire, young.  i dream of leather sandals, bicycle, italian villa, fresh bread.  open breezy shirt, shorts,  sunglasses and a good book.  similar aged soulmate, tall, independent, free-thinking, and just slightly busty :P  the smell of fresh  ground coffee in a filter, lazy sun stretching its beam thru the open shutters.  no other sound but the water carelessly scraping  the rocks down below.  the wind, moving softly thru the trees, leaves falling, green leaves.  she comes to me, on the porch  overlooking the bay.  shes dressed in a collared short sleeve shirt, top 2 buttons open and untucked.  short shorts showing off her  long and elegant legs.  she smells of vanilla, its almost addictive.  her hair waving in the soft breeze, fresh, natural.  her eyes  drive me wild, especially when she looks at me that way.  the sun descends towards the horizon, we sit there, talking.  she has  produced another loving cup of coffee, one that i'll never be able to recreate.  theres no pressure, no external stress.  just us.   she wants nothing except my love, which i offer freely.  i want nothing, but to know she knows i love her.  the kind where u dont  need gifts.  the kind that means she'll never love another but me, even in death.  her back, just above her shorts is warm and  receptive to my hand.  with that touch she knows many things.  i reach up, tickling her spine, slipping my arm underneath her shirt.   we just lie there, soaking up the retreating sun, faces into the breeze.  her cheek is against mine, then she slips her head down  like im her father, and she loves her dad.  shes listening to my easy heart-beat.  i rest my chin on top of her head and embrace  her.  she feels safe in my arms.  then my leg starts getting sore and i grin and bear it, cos nothing can stop this moment.  this is  perfect.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>Gradually the catamaran moves with the receding tide, we're blissfully unaware of the boats gradual motion out  towards deep water.  But thats OK, cos we're moving with it.  Im belly down in water, with my head below the surface.  There is a  clicking sound coming from beneath the numerous finger corals.  Its almost eerie, there should be no sound down here save our  kicking in the water.  The water is just cool enough to feel it, the sun heats my back.  This is perfect.  You're here, in this  liquid kingdom with me.  After a few hours semi-submerged, I get back onboard and help you up.  In the frige there is fresh fruit  juice and the sandwiches we prepared earlier.  Nourishing baguettes, cut into small portions exposing the fillings of roast beef,  gouda cheese, tomato and of course fresh ground pepper.  We sit there on the deck, the sun gently greeting the ocean at the end of  our scope.  The sun and horizon become one, there is love all around.</p></blockquote><br /><blockquote><p>I'm so cross with myself over you.  You complete me then break me.  Why?<br />I realise just how much you take advantage of me, and it hurts.  I don't want to be in this situation, I'm afraid of the grey.  Why  can't it just be black and white hmm?  Instead you leave me trapped here in no-mans-land, halfway between the gutter and stars.  I'm  just a mealpacket in the wind, swept up in this maelstrom you call your life.  I'm dodging the hungry birds, and reaching for the  trees to bring me back to ground.</p><br /><p><em>Pop the cap, flick the drip<br /><br />Pat the arm, insert the tip<br /><br />Push the plunge, breathe in deep.<br /><br />Release the pressure, fall fast asleep.<br /><br /><br /><br />That is what you are for me<br /><br />You're my drug, You're my symptoms.<br /><br />You're evil yet required cos you're good.<br /><br /><br /><br />You're bad for me, but you make me feel good.<br /><br />When I don't see you, I feel alone.<br /><br />When I'm with you, I feel alone.<br /><br />When I'm not feeling alone, its cos I'm not thinking of you.<br /><br />You break me, then make me.</em></p><br /><p>You're like Morphine.  You kill my pain, but I want to be in pain, so you can cure it, just for this hit, just for any hit.<br />You feel so good, coursing through my veins, making me ignore my pain.  But you put me in pain, you ARE my pain.  The worst bit is,  I don't know where to find you, you come to me, and I'm a junkie.  I willfully oblige, I'm powerless.<br />Every shot is timed.  You're riding the highway to my heart, straight through the jugular.  You're a super-car with a rod of flint  igniting off the railing all the way on this one-way-route to bliss.  You ignore the speed limit, carelessly over-taking molecules,  avoiding the barriers with dilligent reflexes.  You're accelerating as you near your intended destination, to deliver your payload  of pleasure.  Wait! I'm so unprepared for it!  STOP! STOP BEFORE YOU KILL US BOTH!  YOU'RE MAD!  ARRRGGHHH AHHHHHHH ahhhhhhhhh,  wooahhh, no ways.  Wow!  Do it again!  What!?  Why not?!?  Come on for fucks sake!  WHY?!?! What the fuck!  GET OUTTA MY FACE!  I  DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

The medium doesn't matter,  but the translation does.  Its an artform, not the paint that paints it, but how it is painted... Its the stroke of the brush, the  thick laying of media.  The paint ripples behind the brush, leaving an undulated texture of chaos, that chaos that binds us. The  finishing of the stroke thru the action.  That paint, how simple it is, how it can be interpretated in so many ways, how it talks to  people who are willing to listen.  Its showing off for me, it dances before my eyes, seductively.  Dances, dances in a way that  defies my own inhibitions.  It is a drug for thine eyes, carelessly I absorb it, and it absorbs me.  We become one.  I don't need a  specific sense to know it is there, cos I can FEEL it.  It touches me inside.  I feel good.</p><br /><p>Silohuetted against a setting sun sky is a magnificent oak tree.  Its a wise old tree, a careful parent.  Underneath its  sheltering branches we spent some undying moments.  Those sort of moments you'll dream of in your sleep in the next world.  Hell, if  the next world was to be perfect, it would be underneath that grand old oak tree.  The wind whistles slowly through the leaves in  the top branches, a soothing sound, giving the tree an impression of youthful animation.  An aura of respect surrounds the tree for  a hundred meters, here everything is in balance.  I remember falling asleep in this idyll, I remember sleeping in its loving hands  and you were there beside me.  It was the sweat and blood of pleasant dreams.  I remember waking with you.  Your hair, joyfully  playing with the wind, full of life.  Your eyes, sparkling with anticipation.  Your lips, ripe with flavour.  Your face, in my  hands.  You're into me, and I into you.  There is no distraction.  How I wish this moment could go on and on and on, a memory is but  a sad attempt at reincarnation.  I know now that I'm ready to pass on, cos I have felt love to the core.</p><br /><p>I'm a spirit, care-free-floating.  I can go anywhere I want.  I've been to all the ends of the earth, watching these silly  mortals go about their little lives, lives that are miniscule next to the scheme of things.  Theres one thing about these mortals  though, they have the equal capacity for greatness as they do archaic evil.  I'm just interested in the good though, I've been  cataloguing it as it happens.  But I'm worried, its waning.  Evil has taken hold of these emotional lemmings.  I can't help but  think they're asking for it, the next deluge.  The previous generation never teaches the next.  Sure, they've tried, but the  inheritors aren't even trying to listen and learn.  Why is that so?  Maybe its just a chronological influence, as you get older you  come to realise theres more to life than getting to your destination.  Who in their right mind would want to die?  Is there a right  mind?  I move on, these humans tire me.  There are much better beings to observe in this rich myriad we call life.  My particular  favourites include a race raised in the cradle of life itself.  They've been around almost as long as I, and even they think like  timeless lightsources, trapped in overbearing shells.  There sense in lack of immortality punishes them, but they respect the cycle.   They understand that their mortal life is a time of teaching, a time to understand yourself.  I smile knowing that for ignorance  there is also great insight.</p></blockquote> </div><div style="text-align:right">
