		<p>Hello netizens and blogophiles.</p>
		<p>I had a naais weekend!  Sheesh.  It's not everyday one gets an opportunity to go see the men's finals of the US Open hey?  Well, What a pity it was a such a walk-over.  Hewitt was totally outclassed.  Filthy Aussies.</p>
		<p>Just before lunch on Saturday we drove down to NYC in a relaxed fashion (well, Gareth drove) and arrived in Queens, NYC in good time.  After chilling out for a while we took the subway into town to watch the ladies finals in Rockerfeller center, where they'd rigged up a huge screen on some grass inbetween the skyscrapers. Cool aura!  After stretching our backs out on the lawn, we decided to head into Central Park rather.  Central Park is uber.  It is the peanut in the dreadfully-bad-for-you M&amp;M.  On one of the roads cutting through the park, a music tent pumped out beefy tunes faster than an italian sausage machine.  This was the cheesy dog, this was the butter on the popcorn.  Rollerbladers in their hundreds were jiving and jamming to the beat all having an excellent time, I couldn't help but smile and try and sway too. :)</p>
		<p>We didn't venture far into central park, but managed to catch some great blues at this one fountain and stair-case area I've seen in countless movies and Law &amp; Order episodes. (oh, they had a 14 episode L&amp;O marathon last monday, over labo(u)r day.)  We headed back into Queens to freshen and dress up to get down to Greenwich Village.</p>
		<p>We heard of a kewl bluesy, rockish place with a low cover-charge called the Bitter End, and after negotiating with the maitre'd got in @ $5.  The first group were a blues / rock / rap hybrid with good stage presence and poor mixing.  Only after 3 Corona's could I actually hear what the lead singer was banging on about: "Scotch!".  The second group was as awful as the lead singer slash pianist's sweaty pink shirt.  Their cover of The Doobie Brothers - Last Train Running was OK.  After some AwEsOmE pizza, we decided to take a cab to Ground Zero to see the great beams of light they'd rigged up for 9/11, I mean, 11/9.  About 40 "Space Cannons" per "Tower" all speckled in the night by masses of moths, beams that stretched to heaven itself.</p>
		<p>The next morning I was woken to tea prepared by a zesty scottish lass, a room-mate of a John's. Norma's friend and fellow eire, Norma is Gareth Gareth's girlfriend, and Gareth Gareth is Gareth's buddy. :P</p>
		<p>After shooting the proverbial breeze with the two room-mates, the other one: Violet, we headed to Gareth Gareth's place where we hooked up for a greasy breakfast and coffee at a place called the Copper Kettle.  Damn, it was good :)</p>
		<p>We took the subway East into Flushing Meadows and took in the vibe at the Open.  After finding our seats and starting to burn in the sun, we milled around waiting for the Men's Final to start.  When it did, we were 1 beer under already and having a kewl time.  Pity the game was such a white-wash. Six love, Seven Six, Six Love. Thats a numerical representation of a sore ass.</p>
		<p>We left NYC at about 9PM, got stuck in traffic outside of Hartford CT, and finally made it home at 1AM.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Its been a splendid and boring week. SepArate, conclude.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Work Hat</h4>
				<p>Imagine being the only english speaker, maybe even british, in a sea of amazonian pygmies.  Pygmies that feed off grubs and maize. You can't speak pygmy.</p>
				<p>Now imagine that you have to work with them in building a hotel, a hotel the likes of which, the world has never seen.  It's mind blowing in stature and budget. It has the latest and greatest architecture, but the problem is, its being built by pygmies, and a tongue-less outsider suffering from Malaria.</p>
				<p>Not only do these pygmies prance around with little to nothing around their waists, but the women look terrible, at least I could use them to store all my pens. They're monkeys with advanced clicking routines (har har), does that make them human?</p>
				<p>I still haven't gone to see the shaman.  He's a wise old man apparently (something I picked up from a rather vocal pygmylet, clicking and waving his hands like an orangutan on speed).  I'm sure this shaman is doping the water supply.</p>
				<p>The village also has its own fresh supply of dodgy promiscuious women...  ...and many happy clients.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Play Hat</h4>
				<p>I haven't played warcraft for a week.  Its kinda crap that way, cos I like the time to myself.  But damn, after a busy weekend, who has time for that!</p>
				<p>On Saturday, Simon, Mandy and I drove to <a href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/newengland/ParkInfo/index.asp" title="Browse.to: SixFlags Theme Parks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SixFlags New England</a>.  We arrived just before the crowds rocked up on a blistering hot autumn day, midday. This place makes Ratanga Junction look spastic.  8 roller-coasters, bungee chairs, water rides as far as the eye can see.  Wow!</p>
				<p>The first ride we went on, after much deliberation, was the Bungee Chair (don't know what its really called, but its basically a chair you sit in, that shoots up a rail, all on air.  Strapping in, I was quite nervous, visibly shaking hands and talking crap.  We had queued for 30 minutes or so, just for this ride.  Strapped in, we all had apprehensive smiles on our faces.  The chair lifted slightly to measure the weight of its occupants and start filling the huge air cylinder within the rail column.  In what must have been a split second, we were at the top of the 50-70m column, screaming our asses off like hysterical children.  What a rush!</p>
				<p>Simon ended up being 2 inches too tall for the Superman ride, which in my opinion was the best ride in the park.  Whilst Mandy and I queued, two people fainted in the heat!  It was about an hour long queue which left us relieved after the sign said it would be 90-120minutes.</p>
				<p>For my first experience on a roller-coaster, it was truly amazing.  I was squealing like a girl the whole trip, heavy positive G's, followed immediately by mind-blowing negative G's. Very smooth.  Sheesh, I can still feel that exhiliration.  Mandy wasn't really vocal on the ride, but I was going: "OH MY WOOORD!!!" and "YEEEHAAA!!!".  Hehe :)</p>
				<p>The rest of the rides were a bit of an anti-climax, especially after the onsetting low of the receding adrenaline.  Also, I think I was spoilt by taking the best roller coaster first. After a short lunch, we ventured deeper into the park. Batman was kewl, you sat in chairs that allowed you to dangle your feet over the edge.  Much more jinking, Mandy bumped her head against the side of the restrainers. :(  Otherwise, too short!</p>
				<p>We went on some of the older wooden roller coasters, rickety is surely the word to describe these machines.  Bone crunching.  The last ride we took at the park was a terribly old coaster, Simon and I sat in the last row, one of the drops, it felt like my spine had been compacted!  Sheesh.</p>
				<p>The drive home was long, but it was good to get back to the hotel.  I crashed.</p>
				<p>Sunday was spent in town, after driving in, we walked to the nearest station and took a train towards the Gardner Musuem, south of Fenway Park.  Here, we saw the first evidence of crimes, baseball smashed windscreens in parked cars.  Dodgy hood.  The Gardner musuem was amazing, an old house, whos owner saught to collect fine arts, works of Rapheal, Rembrandt.  Some of the art was inspiring, but I think we spent too much time there.  We made it back to the general vicinity of our car park, then did some shopping.  Prudential Center, Copley Square, sheesh, a shoppers dream.  But insanely busy. :(</p>
				<p>After dropping Simon off at the airport, we drove the hour-long-trip back home and settled in for the night after doing washing and going over a few photos.</p>
				<p>Today was spent on my back, watching back to back episodes of Law and Order, followed by some Warcraft and a great walk around Westborough.  I installed Tribes Vengeance on my laptop again, and this time it worked!  Albeit at 640x480. :(  Still, its playable and loads of fun!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>That grey area where hats don't fit</h4>
				<p>Mandy got me thinking quite a bit about the trip here.  She's feeling homesick, probably due to the new environnment here.  Its been little over 9 days for her now.  Anyway, this time this trip is totally different.  I've refused to spend any over-time on any of the projects I'm busy on, probably cos I'm not that visible on the project and doing some real lousy work.  So, its like my heart is not in it.  I'll give it another week to decide.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The sun is low, yet warm.  A calm breeze filters over the bay, crisp, refreshing.  Palm trees play in the whisper of the wind, fondling with their fronds.  The water hints of refreshing calm, lapping gently against the sand.  Foot prints, one set deep and long, the other graceful and, perfect.  Shadows within foot prints, speak at length of time's journey itself.  They tell of great stories, even sad stories, stories of an epic journey, stories of love.  Each shadow within each foot print is different to the preceeding one, unique as the amount of pressure applied with each step.  The sets move between each other, sometimes playfully facing the wrong, nay, the direction they've come from.  Crossing over, darting between.  The lighter foot prints often masked by the greater foot prints, inferior in size, yet so amazingly powerful.  This, my friends, is the tracking of a great thing.</p>
			<p>Cloth in the wind, light and flowing. Soft as the sand, caressing her skin under its veil. So very soft.  So soft its melting me like wax from a flame, burning in the middle, burning inside. Wax dripping itself in that heart of fire, evaporating in the presence of such passion. Reforming, reshaping, resurrected.</p>
			<p>Eyes locked, neck and body twisting to maintain that connection.  No care, not even worrying about the next step, new feelings brewing with each step.  New stories to tell in their foot print shadows. Tales of learning of the other.</p>
			<p>Her words, little darts of poison. Poison, entering thru the ears, going directly to my brain, little assassins.  I am defenseless, on purpose.  Poison, so sweet, tasting her vanilla words, flavours of devotion with hints of affection. So savoury. Savouring, yes, I wish time could die, but at the same time, let the wind keep blowing, playing with her hair, the wavelets tickling the beach with little whoops of glee, her smiling, moving her head the way she does that drives me insane, her eyes, burning holes inside me, igniting a feeling within me, a feeling ready to explode, explode with great fire, water and wind all at the same time. The sun should behave itself and not set on that day.  That would be cruel.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>A great day indeed.  We put in some time to show Mandy and Simon the southern and chilled part of Boston, before dropping Simon back off at the Airport.  Mandy seems to be settling OK, caught in holiday mode, which should all end tomorrow :D</p>
		<p>After doing some hectic shopping, we went for a walk, the same walk I did a while back, around the back of the hotel through the lucious suburbs of Westborough.  Its always great to get to know someone you come into contact with on a daily basis.  I really enjoyed my time. Especially the chocolate sundae, covered with nuts and one cherry.</p>
		<p>After returning, and showering, I was back on the road again to meet up with a friend from work, Jessica, and two good friends of hers (one her boyfriend :P).  We watched Hero, well, I didn't just watch it, I sat in awe the whole movie, how very peaceful.  Very elemental, natural yet surreal.  A movie worth watching for a change.  A great way to end a chilled and invigorating day. Jay and Kay will specifically enjoy it.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Its been an interesting week for this here body.  Last weekend we went through to Cambridge after meeting some souf efficans online at <a href="http://www.amaboston.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">amaboston.com</a>.  A delayed view of the Tri Nations final ensued, followed by many beers and a braai of great beef indulgence. (and some fish)</p>
		<p>Sunday was spent having a wicked breakfast, playing Warcraft 3 on <a href="http://www.battle.net/war3/ladder/W3XP-player-profile.aspx?Gateway=Azeroth&amp;PlayerName=nDorfin" title="Browse.to: My WC3 Ladder profile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">US East</a> (doing OK <acronym title="at the moment">atm</acronym>), arbing around and just generally watching time pass with ease.</p>
		<p>Last friday, I was bitching about the social templates, and like a true sheep I followed my shepherd to 3 functions in one week...</p>
		<p>On tuesday, we cracked an invite from some of the edocs goons to go on a booze cruise around Boston harbour, sponsored by BIMA and Google.  200 people on one huge yacht, free booze, excellent company and some crap music. We popped thru to an underground pub / cigar lounge thing afterwards, I obviously wasn't drunk enough.  Then followed by some Chinese food, now normally I'm quite hesitant to try anything oriental, but these dishes were superb.  A great way to end a kewl evening.  Got back to the hotel at 2AM. *heh*</p>
		<p>Today, at 5PM or so, we're heading thru to my first baseball experinece.  The Sox are playing Detroit at Fenway Park, the mecca of all baseball fans.  Should be a thrashing.  Lets hope the baseball isn't as boring as it is on TV :D</p>
		<p>Then on Saturday, we've got two colleagues from SA joining us for some work over here.</p>
		<p>Gym is really helping at the moment.  'Been going 3 times a week (minimum).  Feeling more confident, energetic (when I don't go to sleep at 2AM :P) and just healthier.</p>
		<p>Stop press.  Went to my first baseball game with some colleagues from the office.  The Sox were playing Detroit, so we scalped some tickets after a few beers at a pub just down the road from Fenway Park and tried to watch the game.</p>
		<p>The baseball itself was really boring, but the atmosphere was amazing. The hot dogs were greasy, but just what the doctor ordered after a few pints and double shot of tequila. :P  After the game (a convincing win apparently) we took the 'T' into Boston's market area to check out the nightlife.  We ended up in a great irish pub called the Black Rose and listened to an Irish Folk band play some great music (maybe I was pissed?).  At 12:10 we had to high-tail it back to the train station to catch the last train home.  Got back "home" at 2AM.</p>
		<p>Mandy and Simon, another two colleagues from SA joined us today.  Go team!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>... I'll be back on that airplane, headed to the otherside of the ocean to pursue my career, build my knowledge and find life.  Again.</p>
		<p>These past two weeks have flown by, *cough* but they've also been buried under contemplation, almost consuming.  That last dream is just evidence of whats been going thru my head.</p>
		<p>I still can't figure out if this trip is gonna be good or not.  I know its good for my profesional life, but I think the novelty has worn off.  Its like a trip to a working holiday, not really a holiday in the end.</p>
		<p>It'll be a hard routine again, but something I'm sorta looking forward to.  It'll be good to get back into Gym, see New England during fall, and spend time with more strangers.</p>
		<h3>I'm cross with myself</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Fucking obscurity.  The beauty of grey is no beauty, its a curse.  Black and White, now thats pretty / predictable.  Black is dark, white is light, harbringers of doom, prophets of good.  There is no in-between.</p>
			<p>Grey is faceless, a void, an empty space.  Grey is neither consuming nor generous.  Its just there to piss me off.</p>
			<p>Its the "I don't know" and the "Whatever" intwined, wrapped around itself like a narcissistic being with ten eyes and ten hands, each holding a mirror aimed inwards.</p>
			<p>Grey is pain, grey is selfish.  Grey is just a name, I hope.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Erm...</h3>
		<p>Part of me wants to disappear into that grey.  Become lost.  Forget everyone I know and just vanish.  Escape even?  Change my name, unofficially of course. Forget everyone.</p>
		<p>Am I not enough of a shadow already?  I'm not a shadow, I'm a shadow of a shadow.</p>
		<p>I could escape this life, escape all it means to everyone else.  No-one would know.  Why do I feel like that?</p>
		<p>I already feel like I'm not in contact with my friends enough, like I'm shedding skin. This is a new bug-eyed lizzard version underneath, another malt to go.  I've outgrown everyone already, nobody can keep up.  Where are the new versions of friends that were meant to be released 2 weeks ago?</p>

			<p>Here I am, filling this with bytes.  Bites that fill?  Fill those bitemarks!  What drives me to write?  I used to think I could write, but this isn't writing, this is just another time demanding and consuming exercise. I'm sad, I'm in love with morbid music, I'm lonely, and sometimes it feels good.  Sometimes I just want to cry, cos a song can mean so much.  touch you inside like a swallowed capsule of electricity.  slowly it digest, then explodes within.  writhing and contorting, your body reacts.  limbs in the air at pace, in unknown directions.  no master of this ship, just rudders and bows cutting the water.  raining on the water.  ripples, in every direction.  ripples, contorting and distorting the placid surface, sends shimmering light to the eyes below, looking up, like the sky will fall on their heads.  eyes, so consumed in staring up, oblivious to the world within.  a peaceful world, a world of wonder.  a blue world.  danger lurks but is accepted.  its fluid fate I tell you.  shimmering on the sharp rocks and coral, waving in the waves. why am I here in the water when I could surely fly above it. I have wings, they propel me thru the water effortlessly, all I need to do is stick my head out the water and give it a shot.  shoot up like a bullet, giving it my all, erupt from the surface, feel the air course over my slippery exterior, feel the sun.  I couldn't get bored of flight.  I'm a bird, and all I do is fly.  Its so boring.  Now I'm a man, Sitting in my boat, lean to the edge.  Put your weight into the roll, till you can see your reflection in the water.  Push it a little further till your nose touches the water.  take your last breath.  push it further.  put your eyes under, and see. see like you've never seen before. push it further.  put your ears under the water, let the water fill your drums, pillowing out the sounds beneath, but still listening. New sounds.  Take a deep breath and kiss your air breathing existence goodbye. I'm a fish and my fishtank owner has lost the plot.</p>

		<h3>Tick Tock...</h3>
		<p>This weekend was total crap, yet productive.  I literally locked myself in my room like a little hermit and grafted. I've now got a presentation for tomorrow that looks relatively spiffy, worked on my project for edocs and killed time watching Millennium Season 1 and the Back to the Future Trilogy.</p>
		<p>Another thing I did was clean out my fishtank.  The poor fuckers, I feel so shit.  2 and half months or more without guidance.  Months before that of neglect.  It was amazing to find most of them still alive.  I'm such a terrible pet owner.  So I put them out of their misery and cleaned out the tank.  Like I'm closing another chapter in my life.</p>
		<p>I've had fishtanks since I've had pubic hair.  I even used to work in a Tropical Fish store. The tank is state of the art, with an expensive filter, automatic lights, the whole shebang. Just an incompetent owner. I've done the Amazon thing, the community tank thing, and now just failed at the African Rift Lake setup.  Its my lack of self-discipline.  Its my lack of compassion.  Poor fish.</p>

		<p>Last night, or rather, this morning, I had a really vivid dream.  I almost forgot about it, but there was something so insanely visual about it that I remembered, and therefore remembered the rest of the dream.  I'd like to know what you guys interpret from such a dream.</p>
		<p>I'm on a beach at sunset.  Think of that beach in Contact.  The beach has a really slow slope towards the water, white fine sand, like linen under the feet.</p>
		<p>The water is very still, not a wave in sight, yet the water is crisp and clean.  Dark blue, almost navy.</p>
		<p>The air is warm, giving a temperate or tropical feeling.  There is no wind, pronouncing the stillness of the water.</p>
		<p>The more I look at the low sun, the more it seems to disappear.  I know its still there, cos I can feel the warmth it emits. Each time I try look at the sun setting, the more the sun fades into obscurity and the darker the sky becomes around it, yet the rest of the sky is a bright cyan.</p>
		<p>Soon the horizon is literally melting [heh, thanks Kerry :D] into the water, as the colours mix.  The sky becomes dark blue, and a few of the stars are starting to shine through.</p>
		<p>Stars become little flashlights almost, pointed directly at me.  They're bleached white, yet emit expanding rings of setting-sun-coloured gas and fire.  Almost like they're going supernova, over and over.</p>
		<p>There are a few dominant stars doing this, I can feel the radiation.</p>
		<p>I feel like I'm walking with someone I know and trust at this stage, as we continue walking along the beach...  Until we come across a group of people playing in the water. Some beached whales, the usual holiday fraternity.</p>
		<p>I feel like we're at a holiday resort.</p>
		<p>Then I focus on one individual, a stocky, short-back-and-sides haircut jock, waist deep in the water.  He has a terrible sunburn pattern, stretching from his jaw line, to just above his muscular shoulders.  It is as rosey as drying blood.  As if he was wearing a helmet and a low cut blouse and lay in the sun all day.  The rest of his back and arms were fine.</p>
		<p>I remember walking up to him and saying something along the lines of: "Dude, you're burning!  You should get out of the sun!"</p>

		<p>I think it took me almost 3 days to recover properly from differing timezones and little-to-no-sleep. Friday, we had an awesome day at Kyalami with the team, doing the BMW advanced driving course. I can still remember Carla's whoops of elation experienced in sliding a BMW thru 360 degrees, narrowly avoiding the instructor and coming to a halt off the skidpan.  Some great times indeed, adrenaline highs and the onset of the lows.<br />
		My faith in the company is always improving, we've got a great team, all humble, all in it for each other. If ever there was a company I feel I could grow in, it would be Consology.  You guys rock!<br />
		Weird that I'd think of a company that way, I've been from bad to worse in previous employment, the loose and cold feeling of a huge corprate to a tight and overzealous office run out of a home.</p>
		<p>Now that I'm back, things feel weird, exciting and downright scary, all at the same time.  Its great to be amongst my friends again.  Overseas, I resorted to keeping up to date with friends over MSN Messenger, and making some great new chat friends from all the four corners of the globe.  Now, back in this situation, its like I have little time for chat buddies.  Weird that. Its great to feel like I'm home, but I think I'm outgrowing my current place-where-I-rest-my-head.  After not having played games for almost 2 months, and now having played games almost all weekend, I almost feel sick, almost. (Grr, too much almost)</p>
		<p>I miss such simple pleasures as efficiency, exercise and summer.  Winter here is just-plain-crap.  I'm also in limbo of sorts.  Edocs want us back on the 13<sup>th</sup> of August for another salvo, this time 3-6 months.  Winter in the States could be just-plain-nerve-racking, but another first-time experience.<br />
		Tomorrow, I start work on an Edocs project from the Consology offices.  I've got to do some analytical work, something I haven't done for ages and should have more experience in. Pity, I was looking forward to working with the local crew. :(</p>
		<p>Hmm, work work work.  Blah blah fishpaste.  How about something else...</p>
		<p>I'm at that point in my life where I should consider starting investments.  Playing the stock excahange game, buying a house, that sorta thing.  It'll just have to wait for a few months while I earn some collateral and build my career 7000miles away.  (Grr, work is back)</p>
		<p>Ooer, on Tuesday, in my half-dazed state, I went with the boys to watch Hidalgo.  It made me think of Gladiator in many scenses, probably due to the filming effects such as the parched out exposure and the focusing on the charcter's features. For horse lovers, this movie would be an epic.  The plot wore a bit thin, but the message was good.</p>
		<p>I woke up this morning, only after dreaming of Wacom Tablets.  What can one interpret from that?  Maybe: The bridge between biology and machinery? Or: The better tools of expression?  How about: Feeling freedom in terms of creation?  What do tablet owners think of their little tools? (Not those tools!)  Whacked.</p>
		<p>OK, this is bad.  I've spent an entire journal entry rattling off about my life.  Time to float...</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Transit. Wide windows open to the world. Skirting down a road thru nowhere, not a bump in the asphalt.  Smooth.<br />
		A light fog blankets the valley off the port bow of your streamlined ship, unstirred by the morning sun slowly emerging from its restless nest.<br />
		As the sun loosens its influence from the horizon, the light grows more intense, as if it too is renewed like that day you shall receive.<br />
		Not another car in sight, you open the throttle up a bit, feeling the nervous stimulant tickle your veins like an unknown hand stroking the back of your shoulder.<br />
		In this moment, you feel, no, <em>are</em> alive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wise old trees line the road, planted many generations ago by a farmer caught up in the simple pleasures of life. <br />
		The suns rays streak through the spectating trees, golden hues fill the interior and light up the sticky dust on the windshield in flashes.  The faster you go, the faster it feels.<br />
		Strobing streaks of sun, tricking your iris into closing your pupils, shielding your eyes like blast-shields and then immediately reacting by opening again to the darkness.<br />
		Each time as they open, the receiving retina, ready for more, is blasted with fresh photons.  You can feel the intenisty.<br />
		In this moment, you feel, no, <em>are</em> invincible.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wise old trees turn to spirits, ancestors, egging you on to greatness.  You're in a race, and they're supporters, chanting your name.<br />
		Excited fans, reaching to the skies with their arms and their eagerness, faceless yet familiar.<br />
		Their shadows form interesting shapes in the road and offer your mind a brief harbour from all the painful seas, a place to play.<br />
		The journey becomes easier, your mind refreshed.<br />
		In this moment, everything feels, no, <em>is</em> surreal.
	</p>
	<p>
		You're the main star in an epic film, the camera is focused on you, the scene composed in that golden memory is perfect, and you're staring out the window.<br />
		Its the sorta scene lovelost fools will watch cheap-reproductions-of for many years and know <em>exactly</em> how you feel.<br />
		Its the sorta scene all aspiring directors would die to recreate, yet re-creation is cheap.<br />
		You're the main star in your own epic, but its not yet time for the final credits.<br />
		In this moment of moments, everything <em>is</em> perfect.

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/10961.html'></a> <h3>Typical</h3>
		<p>As South African's we require visas for almost any country.  One such country is Germany.</p>
		<p>We booked a day over at the Sheraton in Frankfurt, after requesting a hotel within the airport terminals, explaining our visa predicament.  Today, when we arrived at Frankfurt Main, we discovered otherwise.  The hotel is outside the airport, and we need visas to leave.  ARGH!</p>
		<p>So, we headed back the way we came, after getting felt up by the passport control nazis.  Only to discover AFTER being felt-up, that we couldn't enter back into the same terminal we just came from due to US flight restrictions.  To make matters worse, trying to head back into the terminal, our bags were checked more thoroughly than when we left.  Holds up anyone?  Certainly some double standards going on, if I was in the US, I'd hijack a plane leaving the US cos the security is so useless when departing.</p>
		<p>We finally found a business lounge on the other side of the airport buildings, and have been here for over 4 hours now.  God bless showers, power outlets and even a little nook to catch some zeds. (err Zees?)  Gareth has crashed after a hang-over induced drowsiness, and I've been tinkering on my PC, sucking on caffeine and the measly bar snacks.</p>
		<p>The view out the window near my cubicle is just amazing though, and makes up for the crapness that is lack of understanding.  I've got a great view over a runway and 2 terminals, watching the lufthansa boeings and airbuses taxi, take off and land. There are about 5 C-5 Galaxy's parked on the opposite end of the runway.  NATO transport perhaps? The weather is crisp yet boring.</p>
		<h3>Decadency at forty-one thousand feet</h3>
		<p>The meals were superb on the Lufthansa flight here.  Supper last night was Caesar salad, pancake filled with duck and melon, crisp rolls and FINALLY some wholewheat bread that actually tasted nutritious. The main course was a fat wad of beef sirloin as tender as fillet, potatoes au gratin and fresh satueed veggies. Desert was Haggen Dasz ice cream, dripping with caramel, bailey's irish cream and praline chocolates. Mmmm!</p>
		<p>This morning we woke to fruit salad, muffins, omelette.  Bliss this is!</p>
		<h3>Splashing out</h3>
		<p>Saturday, whilst waiting for Gareth to finish off his work, I learnt of an Apple store just up the road from the office in Natick.  After following our camp counsellor Larry (heh, the office space we sit in feels like a concentration camp, and Larry is our trustworthy uncle, always looking out for us) to the mall, we walked into the Apple store.  Apple stores are amazing things.  I walked out with a 20gb iPod maxi (the new model) and a carry-case for $330.  Pretty good.  iPod's packaging oozes style and well-thought-full-ness.  I'm still impressed :D</p>
		<p>I've used 6 out of 20gb.</p>
		<h3>The US and cell phones.</h3>
		<p>1-800-<acronym title="FFS">456!</acronym>. The US has such a backwards cellphone industry.  They're in love with crappy flip-phones.  You pay for incoming calls and <acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym>'s. T-mobile in general just sucks.  I made 2 local calls, received 1 international, received 5 SMS's and sent about the same, in the space of 2 months. At $50 registration, I've been totally ripped off. Saturday, when I wanted to call Kerry in Canada (long-distance) I found out I didn't have any air-time!  Happy Days and Jubilation.</p>
		<p>Yet, the demand for edocs' products is outstanding in the US telco industry. European countries are picking up pace, but the bulk of work for edocs has been US based.</p>
		<h3>Starting to feel it...</h3>
		<p>9 hours later, I feel bushed, even my bones are tired.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>This sunday night, we'll be winging our way back to <acronym title="South Africa, A country, Not a state.">SA</acronym>.  A lousy 28 hours of travelling. :(</p>
		<p>Thankfully we've got a booking at the Sheraton in Frankfurt, to sleep off the drowsiness and return balance due to the lack of sleep on the plane.  What better way to get rid of 10 hours of stop-over than sleeping!</p>
		<p>Then, for 2 measly weeks, we're meant to work remotely on <a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: Edocs.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">edocs</a> stuff, from the Consology offices?  Hello, I work for Consology!  Once those 2 weeks are up, we're meant to either fly back here to Natick, MA, or some project in EU.</p>
		<h3>Direction, or fumbling in the dark.</h3>
		<p>Obviously, the topic of my career has come up again.  While I have been blissfully in tune with my current scope, I was recently doing work that was totally and utterly, well, boring.  If you're not learning, you're not really enjoying anything workwise.</p>
		<p>For those of you who don't know, heres the scope of my work...</p>
		<p>To be vague, I'm a web developer.  To be exact, I specialise in client-side markup and presentment in the form of <acronym title="(eXtensible) HyperText Markup Language">(x)HTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>.  "HTML, That's Easy!" I hear you say, and you'd be right. Now ask yourself, is your HTML accessible? Do you rely on table elements to layout your pages?  Do you even have a proper <acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym> entry in your pages and validate your markup against it? If your answers are Yes, No, Yes, you pass. :D</p>
		<p>If not, you're probably part of that conciousness (or lack thereof) that believes that <acronym title="Internet Exploder">IE</acronym> is a good browser, Dreamweaver is the best web development <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> ever and Accessibility is just a word.</p>
		<p>My job of late has been nothing of that, no excitement, no challenges (except the eternal testing of patience).  Its been the use of a third-party translation tool (tool's the word!), with cruddy tag-soup that we HAVE to use, and to make matters worse, probably have to change.  Like I normally do in any uncomfortable situation, I try escape.</p>
		<p>After chatting to the <acronym title="Vice President">VP</acronym> of <a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: Edocs.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">edocs</a> over lunch, I had a better idea of where I wanted to be, and my newly defined role within Consology and Edocs.</p>
		<p>I want to be one of the <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/" title="Browse.to: StopDesign.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Douglas Bowman's</a>, <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com" title="Browse.to: MeyerWeb.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric Meyer's</a> and <a href="http://www.1976design.com" title="Browse.to: 1976Designs.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dunstan's</a> of the wired world.  But at the same time I want to be known as the guy who made web standards possible within a Big-Web-Application&trade; such as Edoc's <acronym title="Telco Billing Manager">TBM</acronym> product.</p>
		<p>Is that too much to ask?</p>
		<p>Slap my forehead for me, I missed an informal meeting of standards-savvy developers right here in Boston on the 13th.  Guess I shoulda hooked up FeedReader ages ago :(</p>
		<h3>One step at a time</h3>
		<p>Information analysis, learning, researching, diverging.  It's all got to start, big time.  I still want to give Struts / Tiles a shot, learn more about <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> / <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>, maybe even some Java.  Then Usability, Analysis, Architecture, sheesh.  Where will I find the time?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Why do artists go to college / varsity?</p>
		<p>I understand that there is much theory and practicality in doing a degree in say Fine Art, but in learning techniques and styles, is the artist not becoming just-another-templatised-artist?  Someone that can be categorised?  "Hmm, a wonderful abstract piece".  Surely art is something that's inside you?  Surely the best art is appealing in its uniqueness?</p>
		<p>Most musicians learn how to play their instruments on their own, others go to classes to learn advanced techniques.  Pianists have to struggle at classes for years to be deemed high-class, garage bands strum until they find a kewl rhythym - Who is the better artist?</p>
		<h3>A calling...</h3>
		<p>Does anyone know anything about counselling in South Africa? Do you need a degree?</p>
		<p>I've been giving some thought about doing a first year B.A Psych or some such, an introductory year?  Anyone done Psych101?</p>

		<p>I'm feeling more useless than a <acronym title="Kill Fucking Chickens">KFC</acronym> bucket in the United Bloats of America, without the chicken.  I can't put my finger on it, but its probably this laborious and seriously boring work I've got to do atm.</p>
		<p>It could also be a total anti-climax after a weekend of thrills and pain.  (weird, I thought weekends lifted spirits, they did on Monday at any rate)</p>
		<h3>Mount Washington, nineteenhundredsomethingmeters, pfft!</h3>
		<p>Can you imagine this hiker-who-doesn't-look-like-a-hiker actually climb a frikkin mountain?  One can't. Scathing. Scalding, hot water, please shut the tap off before I start leaking and turning your water red.</p>
		<p>In my dream, (cos thats what it is) there were 4 of us.  We arrived in New Hampshire early-ish (it felt early-ish) on Saturday morning...  It was really whacked, I dreamt I needed a piss-stop and at this weird little piss-stop, there were only vending machines and a small information kiosk.  Here we picked up a map of the area.  My requirement for a piss-stop vanished immediately and we were on the road again.  Weird huh?</p>
		<p>Upon closer inspection of the map, we read about a magical place called Flume Gorge. An old log-flume with some fantastic water works. (something KayCee would love to see, I thought to myself).  After dangling our possessed cameras in front of our eyes and not hearing the machinations churn inside for hours, we were caught in a loop of a trail around this watery-wonderland filled with other machinationless-camera-toting-individual<wbr />s.  One pair of them even talked to me, it was surreal, there mouths didn't open but I could understand them!</p>
		<p>Then we mounted our chariot once again and headed to meet the wise-old-man-of-the-mountain.  Well, we avoided him actually and went to Pinkham Notch.  We had seen photos of the wise-old-man-of-the-mountain anyway, and even joked about his alter-ego, wise-guy-of-the-mountain.</p>
		<p>After handing our monopoly money over to a puckered-lipped-hotel-manager we had secured our beds for the night, but there was an insatiable need to first rid us of our afternoon.  Heh, buying beer in a dream is a unique experience, I felt like I wasn't dreaming.</p>
		<p>After throwing rocks into the river till my arms hurt (In this dream I could throw with both arms, equally well) and enjoying a collection of niceties hot off the fire, it was time to head to the slumber hovel.</p>
		<p>How many of you dream you're sleeping?</p>
		<p>Early that next morning, we packed our kits and got on our respective steeds.  We were out for a killing, a bounty of epic-movie-based proportions.  Hell yeah, that first saloon we stopped at not only had hot news of our intended prey, but a pretty darn good eggs and bacon if I might say so myself.</p>
		<p>After a goodbye kiss from the wenches, we rode into the wilderness.</p>
		<p>Attitude determines altitude.  Well, it did on the way up.  Dirt trail became shale and loose rock.  Boulders sprouted, and grew. We struggled on, after shooting our horses.</p>
		<p>At one point we stopped and turned around and witnessed creation and it was amazing!  Seeing the Appalachians in all their glory is a sight to be seen, preferably from a few thousand feet up.</p>
		<p>One more section to go, the boulders turn to sharp craggy rocks, lined with our friend Lichen.  This part was tough!  Each step was a step towards the summit. At this point my brain in my dream was playing mental-challenge games with me, both booing and encouraging me.  MUST MAKE IT!  MUST SHOW THIS BEAST WHOS BOSS!  Hello, what's this? A car?! Here?!?!</p>
		<p>Talk about an anti-climax. Every Jim, Ed and Doris was at the top of this mountain, sucking on their low-carb-snacks admiring the view. There was no flag placement, no catching a breathe of fresh air, just jostling with the sugar-toting-sheep.</p>
		<p>The trip down was harder on the knees, toes, shins, ankles, hamstrings, quads, calves and some unknown muscle groups than going up. My toes squealed under the vertical pressure like a piglet trapped beneath a press. Each step was a calculated move, often ending in an unculculated grimace.  But I and therefore we made it.</p>
		<p>Fooood! Slops! Fresh T-Shirt! Relaxing time! We took a drive down the road to a local pub. I was the pre-determined designated driver, so I sucked on my shake / coffee / coke and scoffed down my burger whilst gleefully watching the 3 ou toppies gradually become children all over again.  Beer seems so much more effective after strenuous activities :D  We left about 3 hours or so later (it felt longer) and drove through plenty of small new-hampshire hamlets before coming across a peaceful lake just off the road to nowhere.  Drunken Courage prevailed, as the little babies clambered into the warm waters and played dodgems with the trout.</p>
		<p>After fending off the increasing number of spectators and getting the kids back into the car, we were finally on the road again.  The sun had set a long time ago, so it was after 9PM with 3 hours of driving left.</p>
		<p>Those 3 hours passed quick enough, but when we arrived back at the hotel I was bushed.  Another hectic weekend under the belt. Did I mention this was a dream?  How could a netophile cross gamer geek like me seriously climb a mountain?  I'm warped.</p>
		<h3>Splashing out on music is a good investment</h3>
		<p>Almost a month ago, I bought:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the deaf</li>
			<li>BT - Movement in Still Life</li>
			<li>Audioslave - Audioslave</li>
			<li>Incubus - Morning View</li>
			<li>Seether  - Disclaimer</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Of those 5, BT and Incubus stand shoulders above the rest. Movement in still life is an oldish electronica / euro-dance album with tracks as stead-fast as Godspeed and the smack-down Madskillz.  Recommended for any listener dreaming of the good old electronica days.<br />
		Incubus just can't seem to do any wrong with this album.  After buying "Make Yourself" and burning holes in it, this seemed a logical purchase.  Pity I missed their concert here in Boston. :/<br />
		Audioslave's album is incredible, but filled with nonsense towards the end, probably cos all the popular hits are in the beginning.<br />
		Queens of the Stone Age could be deemed repetitive, but they've got awesome riffs and good experi-metal tracks.<br />
		Now Seether, eish, these guys have lost that rough diamond sound that made them so good.  The production on this US based disc is piss poor in comparison to Saron Gas's Fragile.  Its still good though.
		</p>
		<h3>What else?</h3>
		<p>Our return tickets have been booked for the 25<sup>th</sup> of July.  7 hours of flying to Frankfurt.  No less than 10 hours lay-over in Frankfurt, the worst airport in the world. 11 hours flight back home.  I hope I can sleep on the plane.</p>
		<p>We'll be back in <acronym title="Souf Effica">SA</acronym> in time for a Consology team-building event which is basically a day at the Kyalami Skid-pan playing with BMW's. After 14 or so days we'll probably be back on a plane to Boston again.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

			Barometer drops, brewing clouds, thickening with renewal, laden with life.<br />
			Primer drops, sacrificing themselves like lone lemmings, they're the brave ones.<br />
			They escape the mass of thoughtless ones, the sky-borne social template types.<br />
			Hurtling to earth, friction deforming them as they descend to their doom. Is it doom?<br />
			Ground rush, adrenaline valves wide open, the closing of invisible eyes before the moment of impact.<br />
			You're not alone, my brave friends.  You've inspired others, given them courage.<br />
			With masses in safety, the escape from the uplift is achieved by pooling together.<br />
			It's that moment where you feel alive, when the rain splashes down on everything it can touch.<br />
			You can smell the fresh rain blood on the air, a massacre of molecules.<br />
			The plants reach up towards the obscured sky, yearning for a drop in the right spot.<br />
			Life is renewed, there is hope for another day, everything is relaxed.<br />
			I want to be out there, jumping through the freshest of showers. I want you there with me.<br />

New chances at life, new opportunities, new enemies and new friends.  One specially new friend, someone I can *really* talk to.  What a kewl birthday present - thanks Agent J for introducing us and Agent K for being who you are.</p><br />		<p>I feel stoked, its amazing what a weekend away can do for your spirits.</p><br />		<h3>Washington DC, the sequel.</h3><br />		<p><a class="" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;current=Manhattan.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &gt; Zoomed in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_manhattan.jpg" alt="Manhattan from da sky" loading="lazy" /></a><br />		It all started early on Saturday morning, too early in fact.  Remember what I was saying about efficiency?  We parked at a bus terminal and caught a bus into the airport.  Like clock work, the buses leave on the hour for the rather busy airport that is Logan International.  We self-checked-in and boarded the 737 destined for New York's La Guardia Aiport.  NYC is AMAZING from the air! There after we boarded another connecting flight to Baltimore / Washington International.  It was a snazzy Dash8 32 seater, bumpy, but nice to fly in a prop-driven airplane again.<br />		</p><br />		<p style="clear:both;"><a class="" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;current=PokedSmile.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &gt; Zoomed in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_tired.jpg" alt="Not tired enough to smile..." loading="lazy" /></a><br />		Chris and Heidi collected us from the airport, and after a little shopping we managed to put our bags down.  Just when we thought we could sit down, Chris had arranged for us to go meet some friends, on our bicycles.</p><br />		<p>A few hours later my body was in total agony, but my mind was bouncing up and down like an excited toddler, we completed about 30 kilometers that day cruising Rock Creek Park on the bikes.  They have tunnels for bicycles in DC! It was an amazing experience.  We stopped off to get some beers and Gareth's Camera took the timed shot of me trying to pull a smile through the dizziness.</p><br />		<p style="clear:both;"><a class="" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;current=Trapped.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &gt; Zoomed in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_deerohdear.jpg" alt="Trapped :(" loading="lazy" /></a><br />		On our return we came accross this poor soul, trapped between a busy road and a fence.  She was panting and shaking, not happy about her circumstances :/  We thought it better to move on as some others tried to herd her back to the park.  I arrived home sweating like a convict on execution day, Washington is VERY humid, worse than Durban I rate.  That night, we had an awesome home-cooked-meal-ala-Heidi-again with good friends.  I remember going to sleep that night feeling satisfied. Gareth, Chris, Chris and Paul went out boozing. :D</p><br />		<p>The next day was a lazy one, the type I could picture doing for the rest of my life.  We all woke up late, then mozied our way through to Chris and Heather's place for a waffle breakfast.  Followed by an entertaining round of Cranium, in which Gareth and Chris were visibly fading.  We left for a few zeds cos that night was gonna be busy :D</p><br />		<p style="clear:both;"><a class="" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;current=TheVenue.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &gt; Zoomed in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_thevenue.jpg" alt="Our building!" loading="lazy" /></a><br />		Picture it, or just clicky!  Chris G had arranged for us to sit on the roof of this building from 8 onwards...  The clouds were very low, and jumbos lit up the sky coming into land over the Potomac at Reagan International.  The light gradually faded, Arlington burned bright from accross the river and people flooded the boardwalks 8 storeys below us.  A few beers later, it started.  30 minutes of fiercy firey passion, kaleidoscopes of colour.  $250 000 worth of the best fireworks I've ever seen.  It was nothing short of spectacular.  I'm just sorry I don't have any photos to share, they wouldn't do it justice.</p><br />		<p style="clear:both;"><a class="" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;current=AfterANightOfFire.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &gt; Zoomed in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_gameover.jpg" alt="A group photo!" loading="lazy" /></a><br />		That pretty much meant we had an excellent evening with good friends.  Time was indeed well spent.  That night, I fell asleep to the same feelings from the night before. 2-0, go happiness!</p><br />		<p>Monday was a public holiday as a follow on from the 4th. I lazed around while Chris and Gareth did more cycling, and that night we had a delicious meal over at <a href="http://www.gbrowns.com/" title="Follow your nose to: Low Country Cooking, Georgia Browns style." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Georgia Brown's</a> in downtown Washington.  Chris introduced us to a very nice wine and fried green tomatoes.  This was my birthday time.  The next day, my 25th, we were up early to return to Boston for work. At about 6AM the <acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym>'s started.  Thanks for all the wishes everyone!</p><br />		<h3>Work? Damn.</h3><br />		<p>Work is getting boring, especially after having such a wicked weekend and now getting back to robot work.  I hate not being challenged, well, my patience is being challenged, but still.  If you're not learning anything you should find something else I reckon. I was to do some stuff for BT.com but they're so backwards its scary.  They PAY a company to produce designs for them, pity these numbnuts have no clue on technical standards.  Their designs are uber though.  Check em out at <a href="http://www.agency.com" title="Browse.to.but.come.back: AGENCY.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.agency.com</a>.

		<p>I'm a patient, all I see are the other bodies in their distant beds and the clinical clerks, expressionless, cold, robotic.  Its a dark and musty ward, the beds are damp with sweat and as unpleasant as the food.  The smell is odourless now, it doesn't change. I don't remember being admitted to this hospital, all I know is that I'm here now and I can't get off this bed.  Every second night, I get cleaned by a nurse. Her features make her unsexy, I can't actually tell if she has features. My brain is numb, my vision milky.  I can't feel my feet.  Theres no TV thank goodness, seeing what the outside is like would br a cruel torture in such a lifeless place, no other patients to talk to, just a restless sleep. Its interrupted by hints of dreams and the cleaning staff. Why do they bother keeping this place clean? It's a thankless task.  There is no music here.  There are no sounds other than the clanging of bed pans, no birds happy outside. Just the odd cry for help or the choking on phlegm. Where is the sun?  Where is the warmth?  Where are the pretty nurses, bosoms the size of their hearts and smiles to wash away any misery?  Maybe they take the nursing jobs worth it...  Everyday I lie here and pity my life. Never did I think of actually doing anything about it.  I'm knee deep in my own apathy and haven't bothered to stand. All I need is that providing and prehistoric spark.</p>
		<p>Her name is Michelle. She radiates care, a great listener, even if no-one in the ward can speak.  She makes me want to be better so I can see what she's like outside of this farm for self-pitying fools. She's always prompt.  Even the food she presents just tastes so much better.  In the morning she brings a fresh cup of coffee, that type of coffee that you can smell when you sip it.  Its always the same routine that one can never get bored of, 8AM, shes got a tray of breakfast with that special coffee.  She leaves it at the foot of my bed, just long enough for that aroma to drift towards me, outside of hands-reach.  She motions towards the window and with great finesse opens the blinds and the pane. A fresh breeze, thats her. Every morning I try lift myself up in the bed and pull a smile, a smile through the struggle.  She is my drug, and I'm here till she runs out or I escape myself.</p>
