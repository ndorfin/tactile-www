<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/55816.html'>Growing see-through</a>
I'm in love with ghosts.  Worse still, I'm in love with the idea of being in love with ghosts.<br>These spirits move through my life, passing me by.  They're everywhere and anyone.<br>They might look me in the eyes, but they move on by.<br>They might give me a smile, but they're moving the wrong way.<br>I try grab their hands as they strut away, but my hands pass through their etherealness.<br>Do the ghosts see one another?<br>When do I become a ghost too?<br>Am I not a ghost already - suffering eternal lack of contact.  Eyes tricking me.  Maybe even a scent to tease.  No contact.  No connections.<br>Just empty dreams, wishful expectations and the bitter after-taste of disappointment.<br><br>And to make matter worse, these ghosts are all so fucking polite.  Never wanting to harm, by being too honest.  Instead, they are the long-slow-drowning.  They maim with their venomous bite and kill with their forked tongues.  Snakes, masquerading as ghosts.  Ssssssexy ssssssadissssssstic ssssssssnakesssssss.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/55622.html'>Oh tides, so regular</a>
When I am at the 'face, I produce.  It consumes me.<br>When I am at the hearth, I consume.  It envelopes me.<br>Day and night and the ever-present tugging of the moon, the tides of my savings wax and wane. I am, by these tides, richer by day and poorer by night.<br><br>Steadily I seek to extend the time between these crests and these troughs, living more upon the  median of my mediocrity.  Here I will find my oblivion and my salvation.  Here I will find both nothingness and all the answers I seek.  Here I will float on the surface of the struggle of life, neither drowning nor capable of walking.<br><br>It has been long since an astral body passed near enough to my well that my liquid exterior might distort towards it.  Long have I longed for the gravity of another to tug me amorphous, so that I may flow into it, so that I may meld with it.  Surface to surface, atoms closing until they too fit within another's well.<br>I wonder if the planets too gaze out towards the stars and wish of such cosmic unions.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/55529.html'>Cape to… uh… Cairo</a>
<blockquote><br>A friend of mine and I have embarked on a epic cycling trip from Cape Town to… uh… Cairo.  I'm not sure it's meant to be Cairo, but basically we're going to be traversing the length of Africa by pedal power, and in my case: pedaling barefoot.<br><br>It becomes apparent that I may need to get some footwear after trying on someone else's flip-flops and therefore finding the pedaling much easier.<br><br>We're at tropical bar of sorts, still in South Africa. Its daytime and the open-air pub has wooden decks of several tiers.  We've brought our bicycles into the pub and I'm using the bike's massive tyres (it feels like I'm riding a Penny-farthing) to ascend the stairs between decks.  My elevation whilst seated on the bike is extreme, the wheels are massive and ascending the stairs is easy, until I reach the penultimate tier.  I have 4 more steps to go, but the low-hanging roof of reeds prevents me from fitting below it whilst seated. I dismount, discarding the bike.<br><br>Someone at the pub is asking us about the trip - more specifically, where we're going. I first answer: "Alexandria", but then quickly back it up with a less-confident: "Uh, Cairo".  A map appears in my mind, displaying the Cape to Cairo route with a graphical arrow.  Then the map distorts, and I'm shown a path with a new arrow that seems to indicate that a trip across the Sahara towards Morocco might actually be the shortest path, when I know it not to be true.  There's a big black rimmed circle in the middle of the map over The Congo, as if one should avoid its contents. Several arrows protrude north to various destinations in Northern Africa.<br><br>It is here, in this funky tropical bar that I spot V. She is accompanied by what seems to be the current nameless boyfriend.  I follow V and her boyfriend back to V's new place.  Her house is massive, and I know it's her place, not his.  She's done well for herself and she's her usual confident self.<br><br>V is constantly holding a deck of cards, but these aren't playing cards.<br>They're instructional or reference cards but they feel like relationship aids. She's paging through them, and it seems the cards represent the state of her current relationship with this guy, as if their relationship was based on the progression of the cards, a scripted relationship.  The cards could almost be numbered, or ordered and it seems she's near the end of the deck.  I get the feeling that because she's near the end of the deck that she feels that her relationship with this guy must end, as if it was predetermined.<br><br>All this time, I feel like an observer.  V knows I'm there, but her boyfriend is oblivious, almost as if I'm a spirit that only V knows is there.<br>V leaves the house and she whispers to me when she's alone: "I know you're here for more reasons that just to visit and it would be good if you stayed so we can explore those reasons".<br><br>The dream ends.<br></blockquote><br><br>I'm sorry V for being such an ass.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/55230.html'>Return to Orbit</a>
The flying dagger pierces the veiled sky, blood as thick and black as the night. Into the abyss, home from home.<br>Slipping into a comforting orbit now, minimal effort to remain in this peaceful place of panacea.  Up here I can watch the ants go about their work below.  I can watch from my upside-down hammock, suck the life from this straw of goodness.  It's so still.<br>Why do they hurry about?<br>What is so important?<br><br>The sun is coming around again.  I can see the reddening of the blue against the black, the where of wheres, where our guest is expected.  A smile crosses my face.  The sun is rising and I'm smiling again.<br>I am reborn up here.  Floating in the warm womb, my life support purrs away so diligently and efficiently.<br><br>It's a little lonely up here, but a time spent adjusting perspective is good for the ill mind and the empty soul.  Trying experiences can drain, it's important to know when to improvise a plug and shut the vampiric supply off at its mouth.  To slap it across the face.<br><br>I'm to return one day, return to meaning, return to 'life'.  I think I understand.<br>Is life not about being an observer?<br>Why can't I stay here and watch them?

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/54881.html'>Collections & an invite</a>
<blockquote><br>I'm in the waters off the Cape Coast somewhere, with someone from the Aquarium.  We're doing a collection... any interesting algae, invertebrates and fish should be collected.<br>I've got my head down into the water at times, without goggles. Trying to make out the shapes below in the churning, soapy water.  Everything is kinda of fuzzy - I'm relying on shapes rather than actually seeing what is down below.<br>The water is very shallow and it's packed with organisms and plants.  Some of the fish are easy to see when they move or are frightened away by me coming closer.<br>I've collected some plants, and one or two urchins so far, but nothing overly interesting.  Some of the fish look interesting, but the aquarium has many of them already.<br>Then a small zombie-looking ragged-tooth shark comes at me and I jump away, shouting at my fellow aquarist that there's a shark in the shallows here. It had glazed-over or pickled yellow eyes and that dusky grey coat with some teeth showing.<br>The other aquarist comes over and reviews my collections so far.  I have to throw most of it back because it's not that useful or special.<br><br>Now I'm at my Dad's house.  He's sitting watching TV as usual, and while doing so I make my way through to his bedroom.  I find a roll of chocolate-covered peanuts, and unroll it.  Some of the peanuts are exposed, because it looks like the chocolate was eaten off [which is exactly the opposite of what my Dad would do - he'd try avoid the chocolate and eat only the peanuts]  I put one or two of the whole ones in my mouth.  My dad walks in and busts me, He goes on about how disappointed he is in me.  I careful roll up the rest of them, the way they were, but paying special attention to the task.  It feels quite intricate doing so.<br>I look outside my Dad's bedroom window and see the back garden stretched out as expected, only this time there's a large Rhinoceros in it, coming towards the window.  I point it out to my Dad, but he doesn't believe me.  He approaches the window to see, and then does indeed see it.  We run to another of the bedrooms to get a better look at it.<br>At this point, we can't see the Rhino anymore, but a number of 4x4s are coming through the poor fence at the top of the back yard.  I can see many lights from the house above my dad's property.  The one vehicle looks more like an APC, the driver is making his way right up to the foot of the house!  He stops just in front of the window and I stick my head out the window to talk to him.  We tell him there's a Rhino on the loose and ask if he's chasing it.  I didn't hear his answer, but he hands me a letter.  It's an invite to a kiddies birthday from the neighbours above.  Dad's not keen on going, he doesn't like those neighbours, but somehow he accepts and there are 4 of us going.  My dad, my brother, another 'uncle' [not sure who this is] and I.  We're now sitting at one of the many laid-out tables in the Neighbour's house, dad and my uncle have an uncustomary beer mug in hand and are slowly sipping away at it.<br>I recognise one of the neighbour's little girls who's celebrating her birthday and I wish her happy birthday.<br>My cousin Ingunn is at one of the other tables, and she's being aloof as ever, quietly eating her food and trying not to get involved.<br>The food is simple, but delicious.<br></blockquote>


<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/54573.html'>Delivery boys</a>
<blockquote><br>I'm with my brother and a few others at the underground parking lot of a large shopping mall.<br>We're all positioned around someone's car, with the trunk open.  Inside the trunk there are about 10 2-kilo bags of Hash / Weed.  There are also a number of bankies of Weed seeds.<br>The owner of the car, (and presumably the weed) hands out nylon blue bags to each person standing around the open trunk, places one brick of hash and one bankie of the seeds inside each bag.  He explains how important the seeds are, they will ensure the next generation of crops.<br>We're all to cut our way through the shopping mall to an eventual destination.<br>I say how suspicious it must look with everyone carrying the same type of bag, and having to walk through a crowded shopping mall, so the owner suggests we split up, take different routes or just have greater intervals between us.<br><br>We're off.<br><br>I stop off somewhere in the mall to sit down and chill out for a bit.<br>When I get ready to move on, I notice someone has stolen my bag!  I'm not sure what to do at first, but then I remember that one of my brother's friends lives nearby, and I think surely my brother or one of his friends has my bag.<br>I head through to the suspected place, and sure enough I see my brother along the way in one of the hallways.  He's completely out of it, stumbling.  I ask him where his friend's place is, and he can't answer me properly, instead he's stuttering and being generally incoherent.<br><br>I eventually find the place and everyone inside is goofed.  I find my bag, and to my surprise it's still full.  I leave, I have to drop this bag off as soon as possible.<br></blockquote>


<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/54341.html'>V stays over</a>
<blockquote>V is staying at what feels like my house.  I'm quite nervous in her presence, as if I fear I could do the wrong thing.<br>K & D are gonna pop over for dinner tonight, they're coming on their new bike.  For some reason, they have to pay R150 to enter the complex. The complex feels like it's in JHB somewhere and doesn't feel very safe.<br>I'm meant to be sleeping, and so is V but she's drifting through the house.  I get up and find a note crumpled up in her bed, so I open it up and have a look.  I can't make much sense of it, except that she's making comments on the fact that one has to pay to enter this complex.  Her writing is a mad scrawl and is incredibly complicated / difficult to read.  The writing goes in spirals and is peppered with doodles and little sketches.<br>She's back now and wearing a purple silk nightie.<br>We start talking about something.  She wants to know where the light-switch is for the outside lights.  It's dusk.  I'm not sure where the switch is, but I suggest she starts looking in the lounge. Just as she's about to head through to the lounge, I hear a scratching sound coming from the lounge.  I get up to look, pushing V aside. <br>A small coloured boy is lying down in front of the TV unit with his head below it, trying to unclip the wires from the back - he's obviously trying to steal the TV!<br>I approach him, he's unaware of my presence.<br>I start growling, to which he almost bumps his head as he withdrawls from the TV unit.  His eyes are like saucers and he makes a hasty retreat.  I scream, but it's not a like a roar, instead like a woman would scream.<br></blockquote><br>I wake up hearing my own scream.

Facing my realities has been really humbling.  First and foremost of my problems are related to not connecting with life on a work level, and secondly, playing too many PC games.  It's kinda sad that I needed to see a shrink to finally realise that the shitness in my life was directly related to the amount of gaming I was doing.</li><br><li>Decided to try the socalising thing tonight and was pleasantly surprised with the results.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/53557.html'>Geekweekend</a>
<blockquote><br>Gareth has just won some sort of iron man challenge, or strong man challenge.  All his back problems have been fixed, and being a single guy now he's more virile than ever.  No wonder he won the comp, it's like he's advertising his sexuality.<br>He's being inundated with reporters, so I start to walk around.<br><br>The spectacle of the strong-man competition is now a conference of some sort, all the reporters are avid geeks, and we've got some big names at this conference like Jeremy Keith and Jeffrey Zeldman.  It must be a Web Standards or Web Development conference.<br><br>I'm in the thick of it, and asking Jeremy if they have job openings.<br><br>I'm with someone familiar, not sure who it is.  We make our way down to the rec-room and spot all the regular faces from the GeekDinners, mixed inbetween with the international crowd. We're stepping over tired and half-drunk folk to make it further inside the rec-room, making our way in front of a projector and eventually settling with Jonathan and the rest of the GeekDinner crew.  The atmosphere is quite jovial and feels like a weekend, like this conference happened over a weekend.<br><br>We head outside, and this is the first time I start to notice the girls.  People are eating and laying around, like they're picnicing.  I pick up a strange looking blend between a camera and a telescope.  It's all white, with cheap black plastic grips for the focus and zoom.  As I look thru it and pull the zoom open, the image thru the lens distorts badly - I get the feeling it's been made really cheap, but it's still great looking through it at the trees and activity around us. As I place it down, a girl I associate with Sharika asks me what I think of the telescope camera thing. I replied and said that there's something whacky with the zoom and should probably be fixed.<br>Everyone on the picnic blanket has been eating either  chicken noodle stir-fry or beef noodle stir-fry, split down the middle.  Sharika's side just had chicken, which when I offer her the beef stir fry, I then put two and two together and realised that she was having chicken because of her hindu upbringing.  She turns it down and I leave.<br><br>Now I'm in some sort of house, after making the trek back from the conference and I'm in front of the washbasins in the kitchen, doing dishes.  There's a very attractive international girl with me, she looks like Claire from Heroes. This is the second or third time I've met her.  Anyway, we're doing dishes as normal, cleaning up after all the others that made such a mess at the conference.  I explain to Claire that I went through a really shit time in the last 3 months, and all I'd really want is a good shag with an attractive woman such as herself.  She said she never expected a South African to say such a thing and we both carry on doing dishes.  Then, for some reason, I start swaying, tapping my one foot and start singing...<br>"Might as welllll face it, you're addictedtolove"<br>"Might as welllll face it, you're addictedtolove"<br>"Might as welllll face it, you're addictedtolove"<br>"Might as welllll face it, you're addictedtolove"<br>She looks at me and smiles, but all I can feel is that I'm a stuck record, and can't wait to sing some other lines as the song progresses.  Still, it feels good singing like that.<br>We notice a helicopter or three twirling around the riverrrine valley.  This could well be my dad's house that we're in.  My brother Mike and a few of his friends are in the house too.<br>I focus on one of the helicopters that's flying a little too low, and notice it has a camera strapped underneath it, and a screen inside it, so that when it faces us in the window, I can see it projecting the familiar faces of my brother and his friends as if we were talking on a webcam.  It's a remote-controlled helicopter, and one of my brother's friends has wired it up so that he just looks thru a CCTV screen to see where the helicopter is flying, via it's underslung camera.<br>I explain to Claire how it all works.<br><br>Now, Claire and I are sitting on the roof of the house, on a balcony of sorts.  The helicopter is ascending to come and land on the balcony.  He makes it over the railing, but his tail rotor gets stuck in-between the bars and plumps down.<br>Mike and his friends arrive on the balcony to see what happened, and I explain to the pilot how his cyclic got caught and therefore his collective.  I was trying to use the technical terms, trying to impress him with my knowledge of helicopters, but I fear I may have switched the terms around by mistake.<br></blockquote><br>The dream ends.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/53059.html'>Movie Night</a>
<blockquote><br>I'm to meet an old friend, David, at the movies in a very large shopping mall.<br>My dream starts with me driving a Silver Scooby Sedan.  It's great driving it again.<br>Traffic is intense though, and it seems there is no space to park outside the mall.  So I skip the queues for the outside parking and head into the basement entrance.  Only, the entrance I find myself at seems to be a corporate entrance.<br><br>The ticket issuing machine looks odd.  It has a strange instruction on it to enter a certain password, like a web-from captcha, but it's not very legible or it's just downright confusing.<br>I reverse (no one else is using this entrance) and then decide maybe it's best to try a few combinations instead of reversing.  I pull in front of the machine again and start trying a few key combinations.<br>I notice the gate has opened, but the machine hasn't issued me a ticket.  I drive in anyway.<br>A security guard is standing near the now open gate and watches me pull in.  It's here that I reaiise that I don't have a ticket, so just as I'm thru the entrance I turn the scooby 180 degrees to quickly leave again.<br>The guard stops me and I flip out.<br>"THERE IS NO FUCKING PARKING TICKET.  I'M SO PISSED OFF!  THERE'S NO FUCKING PARKING OUTSIDE! THERE IS NO FUCKING PARKING SPACE OUTSIDE!"<br>Another guard comes over with a bunch of tickets in his hands and gives me one.<br>I thank him and reverse again and find a parking.<br>I take the lift.  It's a very strange lift, since it's both a turnstile and a lift.  When the lift doors open, the clear glass turnstile is revealed, dissecting the lift chamber into four separate parts.  One has to turn the turnstiles, whilst inside the lift to reach the button panel.  I'm scared of getting my hands caught if the turnstile part moves while I'm selecting the floor.  The button panel has 4 or 5 separate smaller panels, each with a different number of buttons.  I struggle to find the correct panel for my lift.  Does each panel take the lift to different places I wonder?  Anyway, I eventually find the right panel.  I'm in the basement level.  There are 4 floors above me.  The movie theatres are on floor 1.  I'm meeting David on floor 3.<br><br>I have some time before David arrives, so I head to the top of the mall (fourth floor) and enter a massive restaurant.  I'm on a little alumninium push-scooter, making my way through the restaurant.  I eventually make it to a free table near the large windows overlooking the city. (Feels like Sandton)<br>A kid notices me on my scooter, he's sitting adjacent to the table I choose.  As I ride past him he pulls me over and says: "You're one of those cellphone and scooter types hey?! I know."  I brush him off, in a polite way. and sit down, folding up my scooter.<br><br>I then realise that I made a mistake coming to the restaurant first, as the movie will be starting soon.  I head out and on the way down the escalators to the movies level I stop in an intermediate level to browse through a huge toy store. There are people everywhere.  It's difficult to walk in the mall.  I duck into the toy store - they have EVERYTHING available.  One kid is playing a Wii-like game in the store entrance where he has to aim and shoot a rifle at the TV. The game has some significance for me.<br>I don't spend much time at the toy store, and head to floor 3 again to find David.<br>We bump into one another on the second floor near the toy store.  His mom is with him. He's on some sort of roller skates and the escalator proves tricky for him, but he manages.<br>At the third floor I bump into an old girlfriend, Lisa.  She's looking gorgeous.  She's immediately in my arms, as if we, like lovers, had planned to meet at the mall too.  I tell Dave to head downstairs and buy the tickets so long, since I've forgotten my scooter in the restaurant.  I'm starting to feel a little stressed out again, but we've got time and a plan.<br>Lisa and I head to the lift and when the door opens we dive into the turnstile inside, sharing a quadrant.<br>A short greek man, and his tall goofy henchman also get into the lift.  The short guy I know from school [All the people I know in this dream so far are from my primary school] as Kriton.<br>He manages to swing the turnstile so that he, in the middle of it, comes into our quadrant. So now, in this tight space, we have a Lisa sandwich, with Kriton on the inside and me on the outside.<br>I fiddle behind me, trying to first align the turnstile so I can press the floor button I need.  My finger is about to get stuck in the revolving turnstile (someone else is moving it!) but the turnstile stops before my finger is in pain.<br><br>Kriton now is making a move on Lisa and Lisa seems to be lapping up the attention.  Kriton asks her if she's ever had rough sex in a lift like this.  She answers No.  Kriton asks her if she'd like to try, to which she accepts. At this point, I don't interfere.  She knows what she wants.<br>Kriton starts putting his greasy greek hands all over Lisa, in that very cramped space. His hands are under her shirt, and soon he's trying to finger her.  She seems upset now.  The lift doors open and I turn the turnstile to jump out.  At this point, it's not clear whether Lisa and/or Kriton get out of the lift.<br>I'm on the wrong goddamn floor and the lift has already left, but it's also not very clear what I'm looking for.  I know I have to go to the restaurant to recover my lost Scooter, but I also have to go to the Toy store for some reason, and it has to do with that shooting game I saw earlier, something inside the game is important.  A message or something.<br>As I get back into another empty lift, I can hear Lisa mumbling to a friend on a different floor: "Men, they're all the same.  They're such pigs!".  I get the feeling she's talking about me, not Kriton.<br><br>The dream ends<br></blockquote>

You're supposed to look up to me.<br>Fuck you for coming into my life, for being yourself, for not living up to my unrealistic dreams.  It's all your fault that I'm fucked up about all this, so fucked up that I think it's all your fault.<br>I'm lost, I feel like I'm in love with the idea of loving you, for being there when you need me.<br>And that hurts.<br><br>Window closed, cold wind outside can't get in. It slips below the door in the gap, the gap wide enough to let in the chill, chill me to the bones, chill me when I should be warm and bathing in your love, instead, you're on the end of the phone, and not my fingertips. My fingers feel alive when they can touch you, and boy, how we touched!  You were melting in my hands and that felt fucking super.  How I wish you were here with me now, and it was all OK, and we could move on and explore life together.  All I have now is your crumpled photograph.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/51807.html'>I don't love you</a>
I wanted to casually say "I love you", but it hurts.<br>To do so would be a lie. I don't love you, we're just exploring each other's bodies, aren't we?<br>I don't know what love is anymore.<br>I've lost the will to write you poetry, or send you gifts.  What is wrong with me?<br><br>Yet, here I sit, wanting to be next to you.  Here I sit, writing, because you evoke these feelings in me that well up and spill over.  I'm angry, because I feel like I've let you down.  Like I could have done so much better.  I've become lazy and it's showing.  I feel disjointed.  I feel confused.<br><br>I've lost my purpose, my one resolve, my "Je suis a toi".  Maybe I'm holding that back because I've offered it before and it was cast aside, as if it was meaningless.  Maybe I'm holding it all back, because it all feels so horribly temporary.<br><br>But then I am reminded that that is the way we are.  It feels natural, it feels dream-like too.  And we understand each other enough to move through the awkwardness we should be feeling.  We can talk, and that is sexy. We finger one another with words and we enjoy it.  Even though the distance seems insurmountable, you're right here by my side.<br><br>I lied. I love you!<br>-Your man whore


<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/51558.html'>In my hands</a>
You fit in my hands.  I am the ruler of kingdoms, ruby-encrusted sceptre to palm.  With a stroke and twiddle of my fingers I dictate the lives (and timely deaths) of my peasants, my peasants at hand.<br>You're so powerless in my hands.<br><br>Your back arches, you present yourself to me.  Neatly in a line, so trusting of your king.<br>You bow before me, dilligent servant.  I am not worthy of being your king.

Manually, you brush past me, your head in front of mine intent on completing something.<br>You're close enough that I can smell your hair, which smells of a flowering glade I could imagine lying down in, on a warm summer evening.<br>The birds would be serenading the sun as it reluctantly turns its back on the trees and their docked inhabitants - even celestial bodies have their duties.<br>I want to step back a bit, but I can't move, frozen by the moment, perhaps still dreaming of whistling to the birds in that glade.  Why did you chose to stand so close to me?<br>I stand my ground, maybe you'll fall into me.  Maybe you'll touch me with your hands.  Maybe you'll turn around and I'll see your eyes looking up into my eyes.<br>Maybe you won't need to say anything.  Maybe I just want to hold you.<br>Maybe you're not as innocent as you pretend to be.  Maybe this is all a game, and I'm the pawn. Aha! You washed your hair on purpose - the pistol in this flowering murder.  You're seducing me, or you're not but I believe it so, because this all feels so surreal, so... sudden.<br>Please let it be real.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/51067.html'>On Loneliness</a>
How it stings that you pass strangers and their eyes never flip over you.  They're avoiding the most basic of human traits, communication.  It's more than that though, they're avoiding a connection.  A connection that could be life changing, a connection that could enrich their lives, lead to stirring adventures, or better yet finding the love of your life.<br><br>If they do look up, it's quickly hidden away.  Ashamedly.<br><br>I once said Hi, and got a Hey back.  That felt good.<br><br>I realised I was lonely when I went out looking for home-office-furniture and found fantasy instead.  It was an especially windy day in Cape Town recently.  I was in Obs, following a lead to check out an office-furniture store since I was in dire need of a proper office-desk.<br>I was nervous as usual, but trying to act confident.  It was a day off for me so I was reasonably relaxed and not stressed for time as it is when I use my lunch breaks to forrage for food or other essentials.<br>I walked inside and greeted the woman who came to aid me on my office-desk quest.  She had a look about her that tickled my fancy: Tall, brunette, studious.<br>She showed me all the options for the desks and I was overwhelmed.  I liked her.  She was kind to me.  She was helpful.  She showed me attention.  A week later I popped the question if she'd like to go out for coffee or lunch.  She ignored me.<br><br>Am I so lonely that I mistake a sales-service as personal attention?<br><br>I joined the Two Oceans Aquarium volunteer program.  I had a yearning to learn more things, help out a conservation effort and lastly, to meet more people.  People I could use to stop feeling so lonely.  It worked, for a while.  I struck up a chatting relationship with a 20-year-old.  I could log on to mxit and find messages from her and not feel so empty.  I could send messages over the wall and get them back.  It was something.<br><br>It was nothing.<br><br>I introduced myself to my one set of neighbours.  I think he was kinda shocked when I did it.  People don't seem to introduce themselves these days.  They don't want to feel obliged to know their neighbours.  They don't want a name to the face that they might see in the mornings as the sheeple leave for work.  What is wrong with us?<br><br>I chatted on Omegle.com Oh boy, now I had hit rock bottom.  I left feeling amused, amused as just how low we had sunk as a society, where the man in the e-street can be treated like total crap.<br><br>"asl?"  the stranger asked.<br>"Does it matter?"  I returned.  All I was looking for was a meaningful conversation, not a leg-humping.<br>"it matters to me. " Lowercase.  Like it's too much effort to use the shift buttons.  A teenager probably.<br>"29/Male/South Africa".  I felt naked.<br>[Your chat partner has left the conversation]<br><br>I had fantasies of creating a female form, that could instantly be anywhere in the world, just to have a conversation.  To feel wanted.  Online.<br><br>Aren't we all lonely? Are we all waiting for someone else to make us less lonely?<br><br>I joined the local soccer club.  I'm playing for the 8ths.  They seem like nice guys so far.  Something else for me to do 3 times a week.  A distraction from being lonely.<br><br>My house echos.<br><br>Tomorrow I go off to find furniture, to muffle the echo. Wish me luck.

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/50733.html'>Finding myself</a>
<blockquote><br>I'm in an Indian market of sorts.  It's crowded with people buying and selling their wares.  Brown hues from the wooden stalls and the items being sold.<br><br>I make my way to where I'm told I can meet 3 wise men who can aid me on my quest to <em>find myself</em>.  I round a corner and see the 3 men, dressed in tattered beige robes all sitting on straw mats.  The youngest of the three is in his early forties, and sporting a red bandanna.  His thick Indian black hair is overflowing from his scalp, as well as his moustache and beard.  He's looking at me as I approach.<br><br>I pop the question: "Can you help me find myself?".  Nonchalantly he responds: "Yes, Yes, I can help, but first you need to buy me a copy of the latest Time magazine."<br>Curious.  How can a Magazine help me?  Why does he need a magazine?<br>My gut was saying that maybe I'm being tricked into buying an expensive overseas magazine for this trickster, but I figured the cost of the magazine is not worth the lost opportunity.<br><br>I head over to a stall resembling a makeshift-news-agency, and find the latest copy of Time.<br>"3 Rupees" the makeshift-news-agent says.  I'm not sure whether that is a hefty sum or not, so I pull a 5 Rupee coin out my pocket and put it in his greasy palm.  He fiddles with the cash register and gives me 4 coins as change.  One of the coins is a malformed 2 Rand coin.  Odd.  I kick myself at the lost opportunity to bargain with the merchant.  I'm probably being ripped-off as a tourist usually is.<br>The news agent wraps the Time magazine in the daily newspaper, as if it needs to be protected from scratches and folds.<br><br>I set back towards the 3 wise men.<br><br>When I approach the three a second time, the youngest of the three motions for me to sit down facing a small wall.  He softly takes the newspaper from my hands as I sit.<br><br>Perched upon the small wall, which is now at chest height, is a small dusty golden mouse standing on his back legs in the center of an aging phonograph.  The mouse looks very life-like, the etching in the gold is very detailed but obscured by the dust.<br><br>"You are the mouse.  What do you do?" the sage says behind me.<br>The mouse is just sitting there.  I don't know what to do.  I realise at that moment that I am indeed the mouse.<br>"What do you do?!" He asks again with a little more authority in his voice.<br>"Do Something!" He commands.<br><br>I reach up to the turn-table of the phonograph and spin it slowly.  The mouse revolves with it, staring that same vacant, life-less stare.<br><br>The light changes. My periphery disappears, as if I'm focusing entirely on the turn-table and the mouse atop it.  The turn-table seems to emit it's own light now.  The dust on the mouse is falling off and a glint appears in the mouse's eyes.  The turn-table has become a scale model of a Parisian street, small Cafés line the cobbled street, cyclists go about their cycling.  It's still turning, this vivid image of life in Paris.   The mouse moves!<br><br>Mischieveously, she plays around, frustrating my Sage. She's running over crates, jumping up and down the curb and between the cyclists.<br>"WHAT DO YOU DO!" Booms the Sage.<br><br>She starts a dancing step inbetween strides and looks like she's now enjoying herself.  I spin the turn-table a little harder.  One of the old men leans over me and places the needle of the phonograph down onto the turn-table.  Music starts playing, albeit with some scratches and bumps.<br><br>The mouse is trying to sing now, but not doing so well at it.  Her voice is croaky and unsure, but still playful.  The Sun is out in this Parisian street and the locals have come to watch the mouse, illuminated by a sunbeam.<br>She starts to sing better, and louder.  Gaining strides in self-confidence and energy.  She's starting to sing like Charlotte Church now.  Youthful, powerful singing.<br>Her dancing has improved too, it looks like she could float on air if she so wishes.<br><br>The scratchy music has given way to an orchestral bloom.  It's lifting, joyful music and seems to be reaching a crescendo.  The mouse readies her final note and delivers it with all the power she has at precisely the right moment when the music reaches its top too.  It's beautiful - Everyone in the Parisian market-scene is overwhelmed.  I too am overwhelmed with joy.<br></blockquote><br><br>What a way to wake up!

<a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/50636.html'>Digging for more diamonds</a>
<blockquote><br>I descended out of the clouds, my view now sharpening on the scene below.<br>A massive crane on tank-tracks is running its programmed route through the raped countryside.  Scars of open earth on either side of the tracks left by this crane.  Its more an excavator than a crane. It's got a strange kidney-shaped route, its tracks visible from altitude.<br><br>I descend further until I'm at ground level, standing in what appears to be a slave-camp.  There are chinese peasants visible at the rock faces and working the earth.  It's not a happy scene.<br><br>My guide appears, she's also chinese. Acting like part-interpreter, part-tour-guide she tells me that all the workers within this industrial complex are trying to look for their ticket out of here.  She introduces me to one of the men, who with a glint in his eye, raises his fingers up to our eye level, grinning with some missing teeth.  Locked between his fore-finger and thumb is a cloudy uncut diamond - 3 carats or more.  He's so happy.<br><br>I look down at the dark-brown soil at my feet and decide I need to start looking too.  I notice some light reflecting back at me from the ground and my heart races.  It could well be a diamond too!  I kneel down to see but I am disappointed to find scores of shards of glass, from broken bottles.  There's so much broken glass I realise that it'll be difficult to find the diamonds, which I know are there.<br></blockquote>
