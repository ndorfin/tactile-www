<p>I'm so disappointed right now.  For the last 3 hours I've been asking all those nasty questions like: How do I want to be remembered?  How could I describe my life at this moment?  Am I happy?</p>
<p>So I went for a "date" with DeeDee, it was more like meeting a new friend.  Why does it have to feel like a date.  I sorta want it to be a date, I think DeeDee could be a great partner through life, but why am I thinking that?  Do I need a partner right now?  What makes me ask that in the first place.  I'm so confused right now.</p>
<p>I went into the date with too many expectations I guess, once again.  I'm trying too hard to start everything right now.  So, had a chat to our resident grey-kop-slash-wise-man Katarn, and we got talking about concepts of Zen, Karma, relationships, friendships etc.  Katarn surprised me at first with his wealth of wisdom, objective view on life.  Now I rely on it when I get the opportunity.  Our chat got me thinking about my direction in life, my way of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>How do I want to be remembered?</strong> Well, I think I'd be happy knowing that people knew I was happy through life, or developed a zest for life.  Someone who set goals and achieved them.  Someone that loved and was loved.  Someone that would be missed.  How goes that plan right now Shaun?  I'll get back to you on that :P</p>
<p><strong>How would I describe my life right now?</strong> I'm an emotional traveller.  I have suffered but I'm trying hard to be positive, this road is rough, but I'm wearing my new boots.  I don't have much to my name and part of me wants to keep it that way, it means I'm more mobile.  At times I feel empty or unappreciated but I know my time is coming. There is always room for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Am I happy?</strong> I have everything to live for.  An exciting career, enough money to keep me out of debt, dreams, friends, family.  Am I happy?!?!  I'm trying hard.  There are times like now, where I put on some emotional music, question my happiness and I just want to cry the healthy cry.  Come on Shaun, Are you happy or not!  Fuck.  Music makes me happy.  Knowing I'm loved makes me happy.  Knowing I'm accepted makes me happy.  Why should the happiness of others over me dictate my own happiness?  I want to be selfish but I can't, I'd feel unhappy about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Emptiness, cold-dark and lonely. Destination: Happiness, warm-light and lovely.  I am that man on the road, journeying alongside the highway of life.  I'm not looking for a lift, my feet work fine, but an offer wouldn't hurt. One step after the next, each step forward is a step closer to the horizon.  My shoes don't fit me just right, they're too new.  The laces come undone too easily too.  I want to ride my bike rather, but I realise that would be cheating.  I've just gotta keep on walking, through the sleet, through the harsh sun, through the refreshing breezes, through the meadows accompanied by the jubilent twittering of jays and larks.  I'm almost there, I'm getting used to the pace.  What happens when I get there?  I hope they've got a nice meal cooked for me.  Who is gonna be at the end?  I want to see familiar faces there.  I want to feel like I've arrived home.  Isn't my home here on the highway, am I not just a beggar of the bi-ways?  I wander into the road like a drunk, I am roadkill.  There are no cars while I stumble on the asphalt, not a car in sight.  Typical.</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel better now, thanks for being here.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>What an awesome week I've had, I hope all 3 of you reading are jealous, just cos I used the word "awesome" again. Friday morning, woke up at 0430, cruised through to the airport at 0530 only to queue for an hour.  Its all worth it I guess since the ticket cost R550 return (be jealous some more mortals!)</p><p>Friday was tiring, helping out with the wedding plans, since I was staying with the family.  I haven't seen these people for 4 years but it felt like I was just there yesterday.  <em>I've never drunk so much over such an extended period.</em> Saturday was better, went to see some more folks, catch up on the happenings.  One such enlightening topic of conversation was the following...</p>
<p>A while back a dear family of friends lost their mother to a suicide. For ages we questioned why, such a selfish thing to do, especially with having 2 children to leave behind.  Well, those questions were answered in a way, turns out the father was an abuser.  While suicide is not the answer, I can understand why such action was taken. Problem is, the lesson hasn't been learnt and the father is still an abusive prick. even to his new s/o.</p>
<p>If there was one theme for this week though, it would have to be love.  The wedding was beautiful, the bride and groom made a picture-perfect couple, relatives came from far and wide yet the reception reeked of debauchery.  I have never seen people trying so hard to get drunk.  I have never seen such open pervertedness in the form of the groom's father, chatting and getting <acronym title="Touchy-Feely">vatterig</acronym> with all the women except his wife at the wedding reception.  A stuffed up speech from the father of the bride.  Such things happen I guess, pass me another beer please Mr. Waiter.  But wow, such gorgeous women.  :) (Before and after the beers, or was I merry the whole weekend?!?)  Didn't have much oppurtunity to ask for phone numbers and such, as they either had jocks attached to their shoulders or I didn't bother.  Do I have to bother?</p>
<p>Sunday, met up with some more mates, caught up on old times, watched some TV for the first time in months. ("Birdy" is a hectic psychological drama.) Monday was equally chilled, and ended when I flew back at 2000, 45 minutes of chatting, to a special someone.  So I asked for her number...  :)  Ever have that, where you talk, and she/he listens and actually adds value to the conversation?  I felt like I could talk to her about anything and she would still be interested.  I'm looking forward to meeting her a second time, She's great.</p>
<blockquote><p>In that moment I wore my heart on my sleeve.  I was open for abuse, but also open to honesty, love, compassion. She had the key, opened my lock with a click, the key was engineered to fit.  Inside, machinations occured, it was a natural process.  Why did it have to be locked in the first place?  With a creaky tug, the door popped open and all the goodness from within was revealed.  Eyes onto focused retinas relayed images of a bond.  A hand reach in and touched the inside.  Touch is the best of the 5 senses without a doubt.  Its eternal, occurs all over, works both ways.  Sight is selfish, sound is selective, smell is 1 dimensional, taste is tasteless, but when two people come together and touch, there is a conduit of feeling, a bridge of thought.  Don't abuse it.</p></blockquote> </div><div style="text-align:right">

Feeling wasted-tired, will feel wasted-tired tomorrow too when I wake up at 0430.<br /><br />I'm reading ChickenHawk by Robert Mason, an autobiography by a American Vietnam Chopper Pilot. Just what I need to read: war stories are great emotional trips, add my dreams of being a chopper pilot and you've got a book I actually <em>WANT</em> to read.  In between the reading I was somewhere halfway to Maputo, enjoying the crisp escarpment air, wild sounds and of course the smell of thatch and bushveld.  Oh, and coughing on second-hand tobacco smoke.  *sigh*.  3/5 days were spent indoors due to the rain, but it was great to be out there again.  The house we stayed in was absolutely amazing, dressed to the nines, making <acronym title="Johannesburg">JHB</acronym> North homes look like houses-of-cards.  7 of us, our own bush-spotting land rover and 5 days to do anything we wanted.  So we drank, played games, drove the <q>landie</q> stukkend.  :)</p><br /><blockquote><p>I can like to wear a jean pant</p></blockquote><br /><p>Its been good to be distant for a while, switched off my cellphone, and focused on chilling out. What really irked me about the weekend was the total lack of nature-appreciation.  Are we losing touch?</p><br /><blockquote><p>There I was, finally alone.  I was at my most humble here, naked in thought. I understood the balance, the right and the wrong, equal in measure but never dealt when not required.  I lived off the land and the land lived off me.  That moment was all defining, when it stood out of the bush and motioned towards me.  Sheepishly watching my reaction's ready to bolt at a hint of aggresiveness.  Humans can't be trusted.  I stood still until I realised how I looked.  Knees in the earth, face in the grass I opened myself up.  She dropped her guard a little and came closer.  I could smell her now.  Warm, wet, her tongue tickled my ear, I chuckled under my breath then slowly let it out, she continued.  I lifted my head and felt loved.</p></blockquote><br /><p>night, goodmorning.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/2072.html'></a> <h3>Appearance vs Cancer</h3><br /><p>So, today was shaveathon day, yesterday like a big deal I setup a pact with Carla that if she dyes her hair, or even better, attempts to shave it off I would do the same.  Carla chickened out as I thought she would (for a shave that is), but it was still fun trying to instil some nerves :)  So, I went along and similarly copped out and got a number 2, to at least give my scalp some sunshine for a week or so.  Next week, its coming off! Oh, that reminds me, I'm not here next week! \o/  Back to the subject at hand, Many guys were getting their pips scoured, so they were really getting into the spirit of things, but I couldn't help but think how many of the people were truly doing it for Cancer...  Thats my curse.</p><br /><p>Carla and I had a one-sided chat on the image thing, How many girls can really say they can shave their heads and not feel anything?  How many guys for that matter?  I was worried about the image thing in my own instance.  Why do we have to conform to a social template?  What or who engineered this social template?  I think hollywood has its part to play in many social aspects, such as image, relationships, style.  Are we doomed to die as Narcissus?<br /><dfn>"One day Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a spring and, in desperation, killed himself."</dfn></p><br /><blockquote><p>Tomorrow, pay R50 for a good cause, and a bad haircut. :)</p></blockquote><br /><h3>My scheduled lack of appearance</h3><br /><p>Quite the schedule for a home-boi, Sunday morning, mission off to a private game farm in Lydenburg owned by Roxanne (Dave's girlfried) family. (... garden-boy's-ex-lover's-dogwalker ...), return Thursday, only to get onto a Durban bound plane early on Friday for the weekend-long wedding of a distant family friend, then crawl back into the office on Monday afternoon.  Phew.</p><br /><p>The game farm is gonna rock, Just about 8 or so of us, a well-stocked holiday retreat, starry skies.  I've been missing doing such things, As a kid we always used to be in the bush, in touch with Nature. (No, not like <acronym title="Dudditts the wonder-boi">uDu</acronym> style :P) I used to be a keen bird-watcher, feathered variety too, but you kinda get bored of these dodgy Indian Myna's in urban life.  Taking the bike, hiking shoes and floppy hat along too, can't wait to hit some jeep trails!  Thankfully / Unfortunately the game farm doesn't have any obnoxiously dangerous animals, which means daywalks are allowed unguided - just gotta watch out for them leopards.</p><br /><p>The Wedding is going to be another saga on its own.  I hate churches.  I like the philosopy that is religion, but you won't catch me being one of the sheep, err, lambs.  I haven't seen Debby for ages, I just hope her fiance isn't a total jock, she's always deserved better than beer-slugging rugby-watching womanisers.  Anyway, going with my Mom, which will be kewl, haven't seen her for 3 months. :/  So yeah, I'll be there, watching another union.  Just as much as I hate churches, I think marriage is just as useless.  Well, thats my dad's fault, say no more.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

Keeping a journal has always been a way to get things off my shoulders, writing down intimate thoughts and reviewing them later.</p><br /><p>I started a livejournal after not doing much research into blogging, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I like and respect the community features as <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/magependragon/" title="browse.to: Pen Dragon&apos;s Journal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">magependragon</a> pointed out, but I don't have as much control over the content as I would have liked (and have found on <a href="http://ndorfin.blogspot.com" title="browse.to: m e t a - p h o r i c a l / a m p h e t a m i n e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blogspot</a>).  I think I'll just mirror blogs...  Maybe look at totally hacking the Stylesheet Overrides for LiveJournal.  OK, so I'm an aspiring web-standards-developer, I want my sites to look good, and behave themselves technically, Livejournal is limited that way.</p><br /><p>More than just technical standards, why am I blogging anyway?  Maybe its kinda selfish, but I write for me first.  Its also an experiment in getting my emotions out there, an experiment in becoming an Extrovert.  <acronym title="Myers Briggs Type: Introvert-iNtuition-Feeling-Perception">INFP</acronym> becomes <acronym title="Myers Briggs Type: Extrovert-iNtuition-Feeling-Perception">ENFP</acronym>?

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/1639.html'></a> <h3>Falling in Love is hard on the needs</h3><br /><p>Love, mutual love, true love, have you ever tried it?  When you say: "I love you", do you know that you don't really need to say it?  Does she know that you love her?  I'm still open to the idea of the relationship built on love, I'm still open to the idea that your soulmate is alive and well, you're just not keeping your eyes open through your journey of life.  Funny how others think that is a total pipe-dream.  If you stop looking for Mrs. Right, you won't find them.<br /><blockquote>Get out the car, talk a walk around, smell the flowers bud.  Yes, that is sunlight beaming down on you, it warms you up from the inside.  Thats where I'll find you, warming under the rays. You'll be carefree, dressed for you.  You're somteimes a dirty driver through life, you push others off the road and then feel terrible afterwards, stopping the car and turning around, just to make sure your hapless victim is OK under the circumstances.  Most of the time though, you're patient, stopping to let the wild-life cross the road, admiring the innocent beauty.  You enjoy the ride through life, as it defines you.  You can't stand the BMW's and Porches of the road, how can people be so vain and arrogant! They're always driving in the emergency lane too, "That part of the road has a purpose you selfish prick." you mutter to yourself.  When you pull over, you can't help but notice how fast these people drive!  What the hell <em>is</em> their hurry.  You hardly see anyone stopped by the side of the road when you're travelling, its weird that way.  Life is a choice of roads, sometimes the route plan is made up far in advance, other times congestion in the roads or convenience dictates your choice of Bi-way.  I wonder where that puts a traffic cop?  Mom, I never knew you were a Spietkop! *gasp*  What about road construction or alterations?  What about traffic lights and pavements?  What happens when you run a red-light?  Where do all these roads go... </blockquote></p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

So here it is, my first <em>official</em> entry.  Should I say what I feel, or censor things?  I'd like to think I'm honest, but I worry about putting my thoughts online for all to see.  Sure, I can cater for friends, registered users, but its the thought in general thats disturbing.  A journal is inherently private, let's see how it goes.</p><br /><h3>The boys in blue</h3><br /><p>Smurfing is rampant in gaming, and as Karl suggested: <q>"suits the introvert"</q>.  I think its dishonourable, as a non-smurfer.  I'd prefer to know who I'm playing against, I'd like to say Hi to clanmates and friends, not have them play as someone else behind my back.  I can understand smurfing where those close to you know who you're playing as, it adds fun to the game by being cheddary with your nick.  If you think smurfing gives you the right to be a total smacktard, please leave my planet.</p><br /><h3>Assimilated</h3><br /><p>I got thinking today about LiveJournal and DeviantArt.  They're containers for thought and expression.  We have online banking portals for our money, personal sites to store our CVs and portfolios.  How long before you start storing other things within technology.  What if the internet is a collective?!  The internet cloud could form a charter of human history, a knowledge base of the human mind, a template of human existence.  Scary.  Next time we send a deep-space probe into the furthest reaches of our galaxy, we should send a censored copy of the internet along too :P</p><br /><h3>Economy:Traffic</h3><br /><p>I wonder if any assessment has been done in South Africa regarding traffic, stress and the economy?  I get stressed driving in bad traffic, often leaving me with a crap feeling when I finally arrive at work. Bad drivers are one thing, but a bad traffic system is worse.  How difficult is it to synchronise traffic lights?! You leave the one robot, drive at the speed limit, and wham, greeted with another red robot.  This not only is a total waste of petrol but puts more wear on the clutch, brakes, suspension etc.  Even in a matrix of robots, there must be a way to synch them.  Also something scary, is how often particular traffic lights fail, show incorrect lights, have missing lights.  What about delivery systems?  How much fat is added to the time taken to deliver a package?!  Surely improving the time spent in traffic means you can deliver more per day!?  Maybe I just think like a first world pig.</p><br /><h3>Friends:Music</h3><br /><p>I subscribe to the idea that you are the product of your friends at any given time.  You, or your friends outgrow each other, some friendships last forever, others were based on a need or a scenario.  The same goes for music.  I think about how much I've changed over the last 10 years and how my style of music has changed too.  Sure, I still love rock, but I'm more open to other genres at the moment.  Before I used to switch off to anything that didn't appeal to my explicit taste in grungy rock music.  Now R&B / HipHop, Metal, heck even Pop has a place in my listening queue.  Music, like a good friend is an awesome thing to have in life.  Now if only I could find the mix between the two, my soulmate would be a rock ballad.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">
