Life put on hold.</b></i></font><br></a> <p>Today has been surreal.  I wasted 2 hours, found my alter-ego and gained 4 hours back. Now I just have to wait before life can continue.</p>
		<p>I tried to check out of the hotel this morning, bright and crisp at 9AM. A record for the month so far.  2 and half hours later, with a broken credit card and my optimist's tail between my legs, I finally managed to leave the hotel.</p>
		<p>Work went OK.  Then work got a lot better when I started chatting to someone who not only interests me to the core, but seems so similar. We must have chatted about everything and then some. So involved, but thoroughly enjoyable.  And I ain't tellin' who it is! :)</p>
		<p>7:30PM and it's time to get my bags and check into my new hotel, the Hilton London Paddington nogal. So I mission downstairs the way I usually do, open the front door and wham, then it hits me.  The smell of fresh pig. Well, no such thing. Foul Pig. There's a bobby outside my work door, and he won't let me out!  Apparently the whole street has been cordened off because of a suspicious vehicle and we're not allowed to leave the building till the police give us the go ahead.</p>
		<p>So, like curious children, my 3 late colleagues and I went upstairs and peeked out over the balcony.  The whole of Picadilly lane is closed off. Police tape everywhere.</p>
		<p>I feel droopy from my intense hunger and exhausting day, exhausting both physically and emotionally.  Well, exhausted emotionally in a good sense.  I'm still thinking of the heart-to-heart-over-IP.</p>
		<p>I've got an idea for a writing topic, watch this space.  And no, my muse is not a femme drenched in lust, but rather justamuse.</p>

			<p>What an atmospheric view! Clouds dotted below, like a silken-see-through-polka-dot-veil, pin pricks of light below.</p>
			<p>England on my left, France on my right.  An eery glow from the half-new moon sets the mood for the slow thoroughfare below and our speedy travel above.</p>
			<p>Over France right now.  The patterns of light below seem the same as on the stinky island, up here even brits and frogs are alike. (Lest they be told).  On the British side, the lights by the channel are condensed and crowded, as if they were all fans pressed against a great fence, the stronger ones at the front holding back the poorer and weaker ones.</p>
			<p>How uncomfortable being so poor or so late.  All you can see are the shoulders and heads of those in front but not actually seeing.  Like religious fools too late for the initial offerings.</p>
			<p>France is light-less now, even the lights have gone to sleep at this early hour. 9PM, was it always early? Or is mankind and womankind setting their collective clocks later and later fuelled by the excitement and challenges laid out before us on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>Her hand bumps into mine and mine into hers.  We're passer-byes but the present allowed more time than usual.  Strange things happen when it's meant to be.  Her rich, brown hair spins out like a top as she turns around to see what her touch has alerted to. At first her eyes are scornful, lit by a fire of vigilante justice, she's out with the mob and the mob is hungry for blood.</p>
			<p>Shielding eyebrows recede as reluctantly as they protected those eyes.  She's looking straight at me, first with that hellfire, then with a look reserved for those chapters describing first contact, first sight.</p>
			<p>"I'm sorry" she flirts. I know she's not sorry, but then again, I don't even know her.</p>
			<p>The mob takes over and soon she fades ino the mess of colours and sounds.  Inside I kick the dog, smash my guitar and curse the day I was made so helpless in the face of such opportunity.</p>

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/28515.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>Home and Away</b></i></font><br></a> <h4>Home</h4>
		<p>There's something to be said about a month away from your normal and routine-driven life. Spending 2 weeks with the feet up or not having to worry about doing the daily grind was a cleansing experience.</p>
		<p>I put on 5 kilo's, caught a tan and opened my eyes. Now I'm struggling to remember.</p>
		<p>Here's what I do remember though...</p>
		<h4>Home away from the house</h4>
		<p>Taking the bike down to Cape Town, in the back of the nDwagon turned out to be a good idea. One particular mountain biking trip came up trumps.  Starting at the bottom of the Durbanville hills in a place called Magic Forest, we ascended amongst the vineyards.  It was a tough climb, grinding in first gear.  The weather was perfect for mountain biking, overcast with a slight breeze. I had to stop numerous times to get my breathe back, it had been ages since my last trip on the bike.  The horizon unfolded infront of us as we reached the high-point, marked by a Trig Beacon. Getting off the bike and looking around was a totally surreal experience.  The clouds were just high enough to see the expansive Kranseberg to the north-east, which we could see all the way from Franschoek to Gordon's bay in the South.  Layers of saucer shaped clouds intersected the mountains, making them look larger than normal, as if their peaks prodded out from the clouds.  We could clearly see Gordon's bay opening up before being obscured by another of the Durbanville Hills.  Looking further to the right, we saw the top of Table Mountain jut out from the rolling hills, smothered in the table-cloth. The dull but streaked grey clouds above meant the colours came out more saturated, something that looked even better through the sunglasses.  It was at about that time that I kicked myself for not bringing the camera. It's not everyday that the smog is in hiding and the clouds pay homage to the vista before you.</p>
		<p>The trip back up to Jo'burg was very similar to the trip down.  Only this time I spent the next morning on the north eastern side of Kimberley at the much nicer Road Lodge.  That morning I woke up semi-early, had breakfast then went out on the mountain bike again.  The Road Lodge overlooks a huge pan, which during certain times of the year is invaded by flocks of Flamingos.  Taking the bike alongside the railway tracks in the blazing 10AM heat wasn't so fun, but being able to edge up to the water and see the Flamingos up close was worth every ounce of lost water.  Returing to the hotel I was being circled by a Fish Eagle, its distinctive call breaking the monotony of the cicadas and finches.  Bliss, and on a bike too.</p>
		<h4>Jo'bag, revisited</h4>
		<p>Being back in Jo'burg feels like I'm back in the same old routine. I don't like it.  Friends make up for it though, it's been great to see the old buddies again. I think I've been spoilt by a great holiday in Cape Town and living in fancy hotels overseas.</p>
		<p>Work here is proving more taxing than normal, mostly because of dealing with connection issues and work ethic.</p>
		<p>Looks like I'm off to the UK for another work-related month, starting this Saturday. If I'm lucky, and my cards play as they should, I should be spending a week in Norway with my cousin Ingunn.  Regardless, I'm just not in the right frame of mind this time for the UK.  It feels like an empty or worthless chore this time, the novelty worn out just like a cheap lucky-packet prize loses it's appeal.</p>
		<p>I want to say more, but now is just not the time. I want to escape. Anonymous and friendly comments keep me going. Thank you.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/28234.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>One month in</b></i></font><br></a> <p>The following happened almost a month ago...</p>
		<h4>A belly full o' lovin'</h4>
		<p>I wish I could marry my mom.  She puts so much effort into those around her, an effort often times that slips by unnoticed. She's that someone throwing the ball back over the wall or handing a lost wallet into lost and found.</p>
		<p>Its been a slog of a few days, primarily due to my joburger sunburn getting me down. Here I am in the most beautiful city in South Africa, it's summer and I have to cower indoors like a vampire.  The sunburn has taken 4 painful days to dissipate and now I'm peeling like I'm cold blooded.  Sif.</p>
		<p>10 days ago I left Joburg in my lonely car for Cape Town.  It was a 2 day journey for me.  I stopped off in Kimberley after the first 4-5 hours of driving.  I had my bike packed in the car, so as soon as I was rooted in Kimberley, I got the bike out and took a sojourn through this odd capital of the Northern Cape.  A brief cycle to the "Big Hole" was not only good fun but stirred many schoolhood memories of our trip to Kimberley.</p>
		<p>As I cycled back to the porta-hotel or Hotel Formula 1, the heavens opened. How odd to be in the dry Northern Cape and experience the fury of a Joburg thunderstorm. That night Tom Robbins and I sat at a busy table and ate a rather mushy and disappointing burger.  He told me of the story of perfume, but I was too distracted by the funny accents and children running through the restaurant.</p>
		<p>Having a car with a decent stockade of fueled-power was a welcome ally on the lengthy Karoo trip.  I was up early and eager to continue my journey.  Queens of the Stone Age, Live, and a few other loud bands played, I sang along to keep myself occupied.  The numerous trucks and idiotic caravan drivers kept me alert though, so before I knew it I was in Laingsberg where I met Andre and Theuns who had just left Cape Town 2 hours earlier.  Was good to catch up.</p>
		<p>Driving through the Hex River Valley and De Doorns on the Silver nDwagon was an experience I'll battle to forget. It's breathtakingly beautiful coming from the arid Karoo, stepping through the portal and being shown the awe and birth of the Berg with its green vineyard laden valley below.</p>
		<p>A short trip after that and I was parked in front of my mom's new house in Vredekloof.  I parked my ass down and 2 beers later I was in total relax mode.  *sigh* I felt like I was home.</p>
		<h4>Questions</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>If you dream your available wife is pregnant but you're constantly thinking of someone else, someone more attractive, what does that say if your so single?  So single.  So single it hurts.</p>
			<p>Like a stupid fucking stun gun that can't arc, one electrode gunning for it's missing partner.  Pushing those electrons out into the nothingness in the awkward hope they'll find home, find their salvation, ascend.  Even electrons have to be useful.  What happens to electrons that are lost?  Do they hold a charge? Or do they get locked up with the bums and strays of this life?  Does the partner electrode actively seek these electrons or do the electrons find her?</p>
			<p>The dumb flower with it's petals sown shut. The pollen inside busting to fulfill it's sole purpose. Sown so shut the bees can't fucking smell the prizes within.</p>
			<p>The moronic tap that drips at night, the valve shot from too much pressure over too much time. It's purpose eroded.  Shouldn't all taps just flow? Why do they need to hold back the surge of goodness within?</p>
			<p>Open the tap, naive girl.  I have a handle, use it.  I'm built for one purpose, to fulfill you. "Je suis a toi."</p>

		<p>The reason for the total crapness all came to a head on Tuesday Morning.  I spent a grand total of 17 hours at the office on Monday, which culminated in a document being sent off to the client 5 hours before the window closed.  I got back to my hotel, groggy for exhaustion at 4AM and decided they won't see me on Tuesday, especially after losing half of Sunday to work too.</p>
		<p>Yesterday was spent suffering from a vision related migraine but was also spent with thoughts swimming through my head.  Obscure, dream induced thoughts.  As if my subconcious was melting into my conciousness at times. (When ever I think of melting, I think of Kerry, Lost in Japan at this very moment).</p>
		<p>I think some much needed toursit time is due this weekend.  It'll be my last weekend in London before I jet back late on the 9th... Maybe a walk around the Thames in the cold, or a visit to the Tate Modern.  This canvas needs some footprint dabs.</p>
		<p>Friday night spurred the eternal questions around being happy. How does one "look" for happiness? Can you even look for happiness?  Isn't happiness like the Tao would preach: "No attachment to material things" or is it more subtle than that, a balance. I'm inclined to think the latter, and sitting here being a baker is not helping at all.  I need to go out there and find my path and just follow it. I need to find out who I really am inside cos I've been getting hints of it for too long now.  Some suggest finding that head-space, 3 months of absolutely nothing, no time constraints, no being tied down. Maybe that's why Tibet is the world's most popular backpacking nation in the world.</p>
		<p>Happiness is internal appreciation, the ice floating in the fizz of your coke on a hot summer day. Happiness is sharing a smile and getting one back. Happiness is knowing you're loved and loving others just as hard and then some.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The sun is lazy today, just doing enough work to keep the chill at bay.  Moderately warm they say.</p>
			<p>Wind: a hurried messenger, fueled by the cold of the arctic waters and it's temperate-under-the-collar customer miles inland.  Always running, never stopping to ask how I am.</p>
			<p>Soft sand whisked up in the stress of the trafficking wind forms long lines across the beach.  Holding hands, these strands of sand never letting go of their peers, their families, their lovers.</p>
			<p>Tired feet massaged by the receding sandy water underneath, gurgling as each step passes. The now defunct sandals bundled together in my left hand.</p>
			<p>I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Her dress seems to play with the wind, curling itself around the pressure and turning it into something graceful.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Mike (my brother) and I go collect Garth and Ross Taylor.  We haven't seen them in years.  I'm driving mom's old Fort Cortina, the one we used to dread driving in Snobville.</p>
			<p>We arrive in good time and they hop in. It feels like we're driving back home at this stage, and for some reason I'm incredibly nervous about my driving ability, especially having 3 peers in the car.</p>
			<p>We stop off somewhere first, all get out, then get back in again.  I feel terribly uncomfortable in my driving position. The seat feels awkward. My brother is sitting behind me yet it's Garth who's knees are digging into the back of my seat. He sarcastically remarks: "Yeah, it's uncomfortable hey?!".</p>
			<p>We're driving through the back streets of Bryanston and Randburg.  I'm driving slowly, perhaps too slow. Other road users behind me are upset, showing their disappointment in my rearview mirrors. I ignore them.  My vision ahead seems obscured. As I make sense of the impairment, its a great big red model double-decker bus perched just behind my steering wheel (on the steering column).  I try sit up straight and can only just see a bit further.  By leaning to the left I can see much better.</p>
			<p>I feel like I'm outside the car, but still in full control. The car is no longer mom's old Ford, but a corsa or some other hatchback. Even red in colour.  I'm looking down at the car.  We're dodging stationary cars, garden service bakkies and stopping for oncoming traffic.  The road users behind me are getting incresingly irritated, one particular individual looks like a rough Harvey Keitel, shaggy jaw, scruffy hair.  When I slip into the oncoming lane, the cars behind me surge ahead of our car in the left lane. Three cars pass, the Harvey Keitel look-alike first, another car and then an old man with thick glasses easily visible.  When the old man passes he uses his hazards to say: "Thanks!", I sarcastically say to myself: "Pleasure old man" and pull a Banzaaai hand sign.</p>
			<p>I've got an easy right turn ahead, one I've travelled many times before as it seems quite familiar. Our slow speed is actually too fast for the turn and I miss the apex.  The car trips into a slide, by looking over my left shoulder I can see a house's gate approaching fast. The car stops spinning at 180 degrees but is still sliding backwards.  I work the controls of the car and we stop centimetres from the gate.  I knew it!  I knew we'd miss it!</p>
			<p>My passengers were obviously distressed but I blow it off, trying to act all confident, inside I feel terrible again.</p>
			<p>As we head into the dip after resuming our course, the Harvey Keitel wannabe tries to tell me something from the side of the road.  I can't tell if he's pissed off with me and wants a confrontation or if he has something to point out to me about the state of my car. (like it could have had a flat or a non-working tail light).  I blow him off again and carry on with the driving. As we descend into the dip, I can see a huge sandbank on the right-hand side.  Our road now has two choices, an early right turn up the embankment or continue on the left (which Garth and Ross reveal later was the better way to go).</p>
			<p>I take the right turn up the sand bank and am outside the vehicle again, looking down at the car and the road ahead.  Dodging the severe bumps and making my own road of the sand and grass.  I reassure the passengers again by pointing out a dirt road ahead of us, headed in the right direction too.</p>
			<p>I'm back inside the car again with my right arm out the window catching air. My hand touches an over-hanging power-line, I didn't feel any electrical current (thank goodness) just the cold steel.  We're now at a cliff-top and there are powerlines everywhere, I grab onto another power-line and now all 4 of us are out of the car, dangling from the lines, worried about which cable to hold onto. The car feels like it's down in the water below.</p>
			<p>A human ladder is the agreed best way off the power lines, but the powerline we're all holding onto starts to sag, we're headed for the water below.  Fear overcomes me.</p>
			<p>As we touch the water a massive surge of electricity courses through the line.  I wake up.</p>

I'm not happy about this. It's starting to snow elsewhere in England, only a matter of time before it hits London.</p>
		<p>Let's see, in the lsat week, I've had to work, worked and then worked some more. Saturday I was sick and still had to work, Sunday I went to see my cousin Donja and her new family.  Amazing what can happen in 5 years :)</p>
		<p>Some of you know just how much I detest contracting to this company, well, I had to chuckle at the following. Their head office is near Slough in a place called Egham. Slough is reknowned for its terrible attitude.  On the BBC, they're running an experimental TV program called: "Making Slough happy".  I don't think that'll help this shit company :D</p>
		<p>On the emotional front, I got an excellent interpretation for the last dream I posted. And subsequently had another hectic dream, which I might post later.</p>
		<p>Tuesday presented an excellent opportunity to do some ad-hoc writing, so please, pull up a seat and tell me what you think...</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Sitting in a laundrette, reading my book which is open on a chapter titled "Happiness". Trying to balance a chocolate brownie and the book, totally cosumed by the book while I consume the brownie, totally. Bits of brownie spill on the pages below, rich chocolate brownie bits. My mouth pitiful for the missing pieces now strewn and smudged on the pages.  The smudges have somehow avoided the text as most of the crumbs descended into the valley created by the pages.  That's what it is, a fold between mountains, a fertile valley slit in two by an angry river.  In the next valley, a new story is waiting to unfold.</p>
			<p>The windows to the laundry are all steamed up, the dryers are running at full tilt after being industriously loaded by the resident physiotherapist.  A man of small stature. A man with a smile and outlook to balance how he is perceived on the outside.  He has a pseudo-Italian accent, it reeks of English abuse, maybe even colonialisation.</p>
			<p>The hum of the dryers is soothing to the inmates, that is except when the loose change and plastic buttons don't knock against the glass windows. No silk shirts or expensive trousers here, this laundry is a place of worship to the meek.  Tokens of gratitude will have to amuse the gods for another few minutes, the gods reacting with brewing thunderstorms and they're cleansing rain.</p>
			<p>A cycle of life within this 25 square meter establishment.  In go the vital ingredients for its existence, out goes the byproduct. The entire process bringing a sense of accomplishment to all.</p>

One can't even shake an adjective out of the mental lucky packet to describe the last week. I'm losing track of my days. Anyway, this should break the 10 day drought. Last night, around 3:30PM I woke up after another whacky dream.  I had my notepad and pen at the ready so jotted it down in the semi-dark.  Here...</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I'm with a family, the father figure reminds me of Bill Cosby, in fact, the whole family reminds me of the Cosby family. Bill's oldest daughter has a crush on me, she's shy for an 18 year old. There is someone else with me at the Cosby residence, a small complex unit in a beautiful autumn park estate.  This person feels like a guardian and observer, maybe even a friend.</p>
			<p>We leave the Cosby house and as we walk out the front door onto the common pathway / roadway, Bill's oldest daughter runs after us so we turn and face her and her mini-entourage of younger brothers and sisters.  She approaches and gives me a light kiss, then shyly recoils.  Her younger siblings giggle in their innocent ways.  She's blushing.  I face her and step closer, and she darts inside after putting a puzzled look on her face.  The younger ones chuckle and follow her into the house.</p>
			<p>I turn for the gate again. I look down to see that all the gardens are demarcated with hundreds of those hang-up knives and forks.  You know, the ones with plastic handles that you can hang on a 6-item rack.  All the metal bits are shoved into the ground, acting as mini-picket fences for the gardens in the complex units.  I pull one out, the fork itself is huge! Twice the normal size at least.  Our curiousity fades, so we walk to the complex entrance.</p>
			<p>The complex itself is open-air, well spaced lots with tall Oak trees, Oak trees with hardly any branches at the lower regions, just tall trunks at eye level. It's autumn, so some golden leaves are perched on the bright green grass. It feels like it's over-cast, but that could be the trees blocking the light.  I don't look up, just down.</p>
			<p>Bill's youngest son (aged 8-10) has been running after us and finally catches up. He's playing the messenger boy for his father, we're to see the old man as soon as possible. A brief walk back to the Cosby house ensues. When we meet Bill inside, he asks us what happened to the 6 chocolate muffins we bought (at Woolworths).  I don't really know the answer but I say: "I gave them to the children", lying about his kids, when I really mean I gave them to the children of the world.</p>
			<p>For the 3<sup>rd</sup> time we leave the Cosby's. This time our walk takes us on an elevated road within the complex.  High grass embankments on either side. Now I feel like I'm at a lake-side holiday resort, it feels Drakensberg-ish, but I can't see any of the mountains.</p>
			<p>Our road out has a view over a lake-side road, within a stone's throw. To the right I hear a mighty freeflow exhaust sound, I say to my walking partner: "I know this car, it has a lot of power!".  As it reveals itself from the right of my view, it looks like a bright yellow Toyota Conquest, but more "boxy".  It has racing stickers all over it, with a bold navy blue 3 word phrase down the door panels, one of the words I can make out to be: "Acton". Perhaps a company name. [For some reason I'm associating this with the "Speend and Sound" livery I've seen on Subaru's.]  As the car barrels down the road, I can now see that it actually has 8 wheels, 2 per axle with huge yellow rims, like tyre-less LEGO wheels. No rubber evident per wheel.  The car makes a stuttering sound and the driver inside brings it to a halt right in front of us. Grating the gears, it groans as he picks up the revs.  Instead of going forward, the car shunts abruptly in reverse, the driver hesitates then carries on going in reverse. Now the driver is not inside anymore and replaced with an overweight black man, dressed in a navy, sky blue and white basketball jacket and NY Yankees cap.  He's sitting on top of the car as if it was a Go-Kart. What happens next really confuses me.  As he's going in reverse, the car flips up onto one set of 4 wheels, with the other 4 in the air.  He's driving it backwards with the car on the left side of wheels and the weight of the car on his road-bearing head.</p>

		<p>I'm slowly plodding through the novel / handbook Nicole gave me on "The Right to Write".  The book is pocket-plethora of inspiration for writing, but I just haven't committed to doing any.  I'd rather read the book than break the reading-chain-of-thought by switching to the PC or paper.  Watching TV is also bad for progress.</p>
		<p>Many themes on the book touch on coincidental aspects of my own life, or how I even started looking at writing.  A good example is how I used to write to myself to "show" those mean people a thing or two. Emotion fuels writing.  Another example is how a simple walk on your own outdoors can open up ideas or bring clarity to those that seemed obscure.  All in all let's just say Nicole is an inspired gift giver :)   I love designers :)</p>
		<p>Continuing on my theme of London, this weekend was action packed...</p>
		<p>On Saturday, I got up early (or rather tried to :D) for breakfast and subsequently took the tube to South Kensington Station.  A short walk through the subway and I emerged at the entrance to the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Natural History Museum</a> just after 11:00AM.  The free entrance was a welcomed surprise, as was the content of the museum. The museum had two fancy exhibits on, the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/wildphoto/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wildlife photographer of the year</a> as well as a massive diamond exhibit. I must have spent over an hour in the Wildlife Photography exhibit, most of the photos were truly awe inspiring.  Some examples and some thoughts below...</p>

Embrace the heavens, embrace the giver of life your soul liberated, your smile extended, your conviction exposed.</p>

		<p>I guess you could picture me smirking like an idiot when I came across the chimp reaching for the termites, in the packed exhibit area.  These little captioned images do little justice for the grandeur I was presented with.</p>
		<p>The rest of museum was good, especially the gem-stone and life-sciences areas. I intended to visit the Science museum too, but it was already 3:30PM and my back was killing me from standing all day.  I got back to the hotel, chilled for a while and gathered my strength for a night out on the town.</p>
		<p>First stop was Battersea Park for the annual Guy Fawkes Fireworks evening. 2 beers, 20 minutes of fireworks and a brandy-'n-coke later I was feeling alive.  So was my bladder, I was busting for a piss. :D  After a train trip back to Victoria Station I was bursting at the seams so headed off to the loo's while everyone else shot the proverbial breeze.  Afterwards we headed to one of the local pubs until they kicked us out at closing time. The rest of the evening was spent having cocktails and shooters over Monopoly and Music.  The Monopoly didn't go down so well, but the music, booze and the friendly banter sure did! :D I got back to the hotel just before 4:30AM, another great night in the bag!</p>
		<p>Sunday I chilled in the hotel lounge to a cappucino and an awesome burger, completing games of Sudoku in all the provided newspapers. (I'm such an addict :D)</p>

		<p>On Wednesday, I jumped on a tube train or three and got out at Victoria Station, a short walk and a return ticket later, I was on the train to Clapham Junction.  Here, I met up with Gareth and a few of his friends at a pub called "The Fine Line".  One too many Grolsch's later, I found myself playing chicken with the cars whilst heading back to the train station, a spring in my step and getting weird glances from passer-bys.  I blame the overly loud Queens of the Stone Age album screaming in my ears.</p>
		<p>Last night was just as good.  Its not everyday you can hook up with some old buddies and take off from where you left, as if time was immaterial.  I hadn't seen Jennie for almost 5 years, and Chief for 2.</p>
		<p>They made the move to London about 3-4 years ago and haven't looked back.  It got me thinking about my time in London so far, which under the circumstances, has been quite poor. It seems job opportunities for my line of work are literally bursting at the seams.  I'd be stupid to ignore them but could I really live here?  Maybe I can earn pounds in SA :D</p>
		<p>All in all, let's just say the last two days have been much better!</p>
		<h4>London itself, after a week.</h4>
		<p>Gloom, as I said earlier, has equal presence as the number of hot spanish girls. People draped in dark jackets and coats, the only bustle of colour coming from the odd tie or eccentric old bat.  I've never seen so many suits in my life before.</p>
		<p>The buildings look run-down and repeatedly restored plus rained-on for ages.  Imagine mounds of dark red earth with visible erosion marks stretching from the top down.  Now add a building image over the mound of earth. Get the picture?</p>
		<p>The tree's leaves are just starting to turn red.  With the office being directly opposite Green Park, it makes for a beautiful morning walk from Green Park station to the offices on Piccadilly Lane. That is, when I'm not dodging the other panic stricken pedestrians and the hell-cabs.</p>
		<p>Tube stops are odd.  The people on the trains dare not stare, smile (and therefore laugh) let alone talk to strangers.  Instead, everyone is frowning at their own shoes, or trying to make it look like they're reading the paper.  The busiest time I've been on the tubes has been at 6:30 and is NOT an enjoyable experience.  Carrying a laptop on a crammed train left me checking my laptop bag every 10 seconds. There are ALWAYS people bumping into you.  By the time you get off the tube, your nasal passages have been invaded by a black soot.</p>
		<p>I haven't tried the buses yet and was told I should.  We'll see, right now I'm happy being a creature of habit. :D</p>
		<p>Weather has been good apparently. (Yes, Apparently!) Most of my time has been spent in the office, or sleeping, so I can't really comment :D  It did rain badly the one day, which proved highly irritating.  Thankfully I had my massive rain-jacket with me so avoided being totally soaked.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I have R17k worth of holds on my credit card. Yay. Like a fool, I persist with my stay in my 140 pound per night hotel and its 15 pound breakfasts, all in the blind hope that my contract holders will pay it back, as they should.</p>
		<p>The work is incredibly frustrating, I can't do my work, because it's too premature. It's like trying to build the scale model with no plans to work off.</p>

			<p>We're on the train again, a route done a few times already.  The lights whizz by, always in straight lines, always till the glass starts to warp the light into the nothingness of the window frame. The lights are like fireflies perched on leaves, while I cycle madly through the forest, yes, at night. A light is hope in the darkness, a signal for your loved one to come home safely to. A warning for the demons to stay at ten paces and not approach for fear of their own oblivion. Cos even demons fear oblivion.</p>
			<p>Different coloured lights, some burning like fire others burning the synthetic wick inside, fueled by the rare gases that make up our own intake too. Whites as hot as 6 watts and silvery blue burn holes in my eyes and leave their children behind, like a mother wasp. Only these children are quickly smeared and their messy entrails leave long stains down the direction I'm going. I'm not in control of this bicycle, instead, its the space between the lights that guide my vehicle down a path that I know of, but can't control. </p>

		<p>I had a wonderful evening.  It's 12PM, I'm on an hourlong train out of London to my tireless bed in Newbury.  My evening was shared with my chinese colleagues and one special spanish dear, Alesha. We invaded a crampy italian restaurant a stone's throw away from the corner of James and Bond Street in central London.  The food was great, but then I've always been a sucker for Lasagna, just like Garfield.  It wasn't long before the topic of chinese names came up, and how to draw (or rather write) your name in chinese.  Often, like in native american culture, the chinese give associative names to their western peers.  While Alesha went outside to grab a smoke, I asked my comrades for Alesha's chinese name.  "Li Wei" they said, or rather, "Lee Way".  On a clean napkin with a special pen, Jing scribed Alesha's name with artistic flair. Alesha got back and we presented her with her new name. Li Wei means: Beautiful Smile. Alesha wore her name with great fervour.</p>
		<p>Soon the tables were turned, and the topic of my own name came up. "Shaun" is very similar to a chinese word for the 9th layer of sky. "Tian Xiao" or, reaching for the sky with great speed. A metaphor for my experience on this trip. Jing later remarked, that because I was so tall, my name had more meaning that just the sound of Shaun in chinese.  Mmm, cheesy. :)</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

			<p>We left the blinds open last night. It was too hot anyway to close them. This morning, the sun rose as it normally did but unabashed, casting its rays on our sleeping faces.  It wasn't long before the orange built up behind our eyelids and woke us gently. I remember opening my eyes to see you still sleeping, facing me, half your beautiful face buried in the pillow. When you sleep, you smile - A content smile. I smiled too.  That's the magic of us, even in such little ways do we find joy from and with one another. I must have smiled a tad too bright, because at that moment you woke to see me smiling at you. Your eyes glinted, sparks flew. You make me feel wonderful.</p>
			<p>With an underhanded slap, you pulled the covers over our heads, grinning the way you do, such a naughty grin. The sheets are cool and feel great on our relaxed frames. The rush of warming air and the smell of you permeate my senses. Your hands are soft and just the right tempreature.  Not too hot to be glowing like our passion, or too cold to make me recoil.  Just right.</p>
			<p>Your hair is wild but still behaving. I love your rich hair, your essence flowing around you. So soft to the touch.</p>
			<p>Toes and feet start to play at the exposed end of the bed.</p>
			<p>The phone rings. It's your boss, you need to come into work earlier than normal. You're disappointed, but I'm gloating to myself.  I'm in love with one respected in her career, she's so busy but she always makes time for me. I know that she loves me more than amount of effort she puts into her work, which is beyond the call of duty anyway.</p>
			<p>The kettle boils.  You love the way I make you that special coffee and deliver it to you in my boxers. If coffee had meaning, this cup was laden with adoration. I would wake at any hour to deliver you this special coffee just to see that expression on your face as you take the first sip.  It's the hot thrill, warming satisfaction you get.  I recall the way you kiss me when you pull the cup to your lips. Like a dumbstruck kid, I watch you sip your coffee in total fascination.  Don't look at me like that, or you'll be late for work! :)</p>

		<p>Nicole is someone special, she's like the sister I never had. She and I work well together. For my birthday this year, she got me two inspired and inspiring little books, one "The Pocket Muse" and the other, a book on "The Right to Write".  Chapter 1 of the Right to Write has the following exercise...</p>
		<p>Describe how and what you are feeling right now. Write about anything and everything that comes to mind. Be whatever and however you are at this moment. Get current. Feel the current of your thoughts and emotions. Here goes...</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Beat. Beat. Something I suck at. Something I wish I could improve. I dream of making music, writing lyrics, making others feel how I feel when I hear and recognise an awesome song. One such song is Guano Apes - Quietly. Heh, it reminds me of someone special, who said she had given me the song, when I know it was other way round. She's fun like that. The song itself has meaning through its rhythym. The drumming is not a fixed rhythym, but rather natural. Like a heart beat is not just a blip-blip-blip, it has a recognisable wave, yet each one is unique, like a snowflake. How does a heartbeat represent a snowflake? A snowflake is shaped out of the chaos of winds, water and particles in the air. A heartbeat is the order in our chaos. it's consistent. You'll always have snowflakes in snow. Isn't a snowflake the heartbeat of a winter's storm? Isn't the heartbeat the source of life? Both governed by laws we don't fully understand. A snowflake is naturally beautiful, just like a heartbeat. It's just there, it just exists, it shows us that even the smallest things have the greatest meaning, that we cannot underestimate the simple things in life. You are my snowflake, my heartbeat. You melt in my hands, you pulse in my hands. You're amazing. You're the source of my inspiration, my energy, my willingnes to live. You remind me that I'm alive. I listen to my pulse. Beat beat beat.</p>
			<p>The song changes. It's more chilled. Yellow. Yellow is the colour of cowards, of warning, of sweetness.  Yellow goes well with shades of red, black and sometimes blue. Black and blue. Bruising. Injury. Thoughtless action. Rewind, always rewinding to the moment to find out what went wrong. Why? Accidents happen. Accidents make you stronger. Life without accidents, faults, errors would be pretty, pretty boring. Accidents remind us we're human, we're allowed to make mistakes. We're not allowed to make them happen again though. Some people live perpetual accidents. Dodging one accident to have another. Like lying. If you lie, you're permanently having accidents. Do things right or don't do them.</p>

Which is good I guess, gives me more time to organise goodies before I make like an instinctless bird, flying north into winter.</p>
		<p>This time, the adventure will be different.  I'll have my own friends to chill with over weekends and I'll be going on my own.  They always say that if you go on your own somewhere, you're bound to come out with more friends.  I certainly felt this on my last trip to the US.  Heck, I even asked someone special out on a date!</p>
		<p>On the negative side, it means everyone thinks I'm in the UK already.  (I'm sure you can picture the MSN transcripts.)  It's my own fault for being so energetic about the whole thing, heh.</p>
		<p>A week's delay also means another week of driving the scoob.  It's going to be 3 weeks soon since I got it.  Amazing how quick time flies, especially when you're having fun. :)  Mike and Mom offered to sell my old car down in Cape Town and even organised a friend to drive it down for me.  It certainly lifted a lot of weight off my shoulders knowing it's in their capable hands.  I love you mom! :D</p>

			<p>Do you know that when you smile at me, you're killing me inside?  It's like a cancer getting a push toward the oblivion of it's host. Do you know that when you look at me the way you innocently do, you're burning holes through me?</p>
			<p>Maybe you're not so oblivious, maybe you're actually playing me for the sucker I am. If I ever find out, I'll be morose for the fact that I've spent so much energy on one so thought and care less.</p>
			<p>While you might know or think that I know and think you're my everything, you're also my everything because I'm truly alive when I love you.  It's selfish that way but you bring out the best of me.</p>

Trucks on roids, cascade down the lanes delivering their payload. Their drivers crazy, keeping up a frantic pace, tired from the concentration required all this time.  At the end of the route, salvation, reward and of course frothing cold beers served by big-tittied wenches.  Not one driver knows what his iron steed has been hauling, only that the delivery is important and well paid for.  The source, well known.  The destination, dangerous.  Damn these drug dealers.</p>

		<p>Bad prose and homosexuals-in-disguise aside, it's been a good few weeks.  Well actually, the last week was both extremely frustrating and exciting at the same time (sounds like sekz).</p>
		<p>You see, I decided to enjoy my money for a change.</p>
		<p>This last week has been a realisation of a dream.  After 2 years of saving (admittedly for my Helicopter <acronym title="Private Pilots License">PPL</acronym>), 2 months of looking (admittedly fueled by Jayesh's 2000 GT), and 2 weeks of anguish, I bought a second-hand Subaru 2003 WRX Sportswagon.

		<p>Now, all this anticipation, all this not-quite-realised excitement is to be hampered for 2 months.  Next Friday I'm leaving on a jet plane (the real type) for a contract in the UK. I haven't even sold my Nissan yet :/</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<li><b> brunettes</b>:<br>Ahh Brunettes. Things of beauty they are. Nothing appeals to me more than a gal with a brown-tinged-brow, hazel-long-hair and eyes-of-earth-tone.  *sigh*</li><li><b> cynicism</b>:<br>Someone once said: A cynic knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.  How true. Well, I value somethings. :)</li><li><b> gladiator</b>:<br>Walking through the wheat, hand outstreched, palm down towards to the soft kernel tips, flying above the wheat.

		<p>In about 30 mins time, I'll be off to Illovo, to attend my first session at the Chatillon Institute.  Sounds complicated, but basically Monsieur de Chatillon (and he prefers being called that) presents a lecture on Carl Jung's work. Any aspect.</p>
		<p>For those that are too lazy to google Carl Jung, or look him up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>, he was a Swiss Psychiatrist specialising in the darker aspects of human behaviour.  Specifically the subconcious, dream symbology and other unexplored aspects that make up: us.</p>
		<p>Should be a nerve-wracking first lecture, as I haven't been to any form of school for close on 7 years.  Scary hey?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I'm so tired I've been squiting to read this as I type.  Thank goodness for corrective measures with hefty price tags.</p>
		<p>I've been recently self-diagnosed as a hermit.  It's OK, they like me here, the cooking sucks though.  The last two months have been in a total mindless and repetitive state, no, Ohio even.  I've been chasing my pegasus as well as battling mediocrity.  Two noble yet thoroughly pointless endeavours.  I've been missing my writing, and reading, and socialising. And all those other normal non-hermit-like activities.  Guess one doesn't write or read in groups though.  Scratch that from the list.</p>
		<p>I was browsing through some old photos, listening to some sombre music, when I literally cracked.  At the office too.  That's not healthy.  No one saw me though.  That's healthy.  So many memories welling up inside me, my brim battling to contain the surge.  Missing loved ones, totally unhealthy food, and the scent of adventure on the wind.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Crutches in armpits, full weight bearing down the alumninium struts.  How funny the tracks must look in the sand.  A walking tripod with rubber feet. Tracks, articificial tracks, no scent to discern. Tracks that lead nowhere, just plodding on. It's not the destination, it's the action.  A noun, not a verb, fool. Comma abuse, I should be locked up, chained down and interrogated sideways.  Too many questions hurt my overcrowded brain.  My roads are full of ditches and potholes. There's no water on tap or electricity on plug, or is that socket. It's now twenty to bed-time, but I don't want to sleep.  But I do.  It's the waking I don't want to do. To sleep, perchance to have persistent nightmares. Sick. Where is my doctor?</p>

		<p>2 days ago, I had a strangely serene dream.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Russia, or some Eastern European Country.  Slovakia?  We're driving in what feels like a Mercedes G-Model 4x4 (A "Gelaendewagen"). The "we" feels like work buddies, all male.  I'm sitting in the backseat.  Not sure who is driving.</p>
			<p>We're driving on some sort of elevated highway, elevated enough not to see the ground.  Instead of typical lanes in a highway, the "roads" are actually connections between various floating platforms, with these connections jutting out at right angles and humped in the middle, like old bridges over waterways. There are people everywhere, but all heading in the same direction.</p>
			<p>We emerge from the clouds to see what I can only describe as a huge themepark cross lost city looming over us.  The architecture is extremely modern and captivating.  I take out the camera and start taking snaps of the people on the road with this amazing backdrop filling up the lens.  We're in the shadow of the city as we descend towards ground level.  My nose starts bleeding profusely, so I turn the camera on myself and jokingly take pictures. My colleagues are not worried about this activity.</p>
			<p>Our 4x4 is now a bakkie of some sorts, and some pedestrians have hopped into the back.  They're speaking Afrikaans, which seems highly irregular in this country filled with Eastern Europeans and Russians.  I can't remember what they were saying, but I told them in Afrikaans not to talk such shit.  They were not surprised that I understood them and could even talk back to them.</p>
			<p>We hop out of the 4x4 and start walking with the other pedestrians.  We're now at the edge of an immense lake, beautifually serene. The clouds are low but they lift up to reveal a beautiful alpine like mountain range, with one specific peak standing heads and shoulders above the range.  "This is where I should go" I tell myself.  There are still tons of people around, the vibe is certainly student like, the crowd is young yet yearning for knowledge.</p>
			<p>After walking around the lake's edge to the right, we're faced with a massive flight of stairs that crest a little hill.  They lead to this place of knowledge, but I can't see it from the base of the stairs.  The stairs are irregular in angle, obviously catering to the contours of the land beneath them.  I get the feeling that those stairs are important, the stairway to enlightenment.</p>
			<p>There are a lot of americans at the base of these stairs, lounging around, resting on the rocks like fat and tired tourists. It's also here that I see the first sign of ladies.  I hear a lot of whining amongst them, they're here like everyone else, but don't have the energy to climb the stairs.  I remember turning around at this stage and standing on the rocks, looking back at the amazing city and the lake to our left. I also recall bumping into an old friend there before the dream ended.</p>

		<p>My life is a bumpy ride over emotional altitude. I'll have periods of raw excitement followed by feeling just plain low.  It's always been that way.</p>
		<p>I've been thinking a lot about my makeup, how I was structured. Would things be different for me if I was brought up in a separate environment? Would I learn to love myself if I was encouraged and congratulated through life?</p>
		<p>Now given a foundation, shaky or not, does that still prevent a building from reaching heights?  Does a building need to reach heights to be impressive? Does a building need to be impressive if it offers exactly what a building should? No. What do you have the capacity to change?  The architecture. It will take time to rebuild but it will be a feat unto itself.  You've got is the soil beneath your foundations, that stupidly insignificant stake of earth. You've also got a team of builders, eager for work, eager for producing quality.  All you've really got is a blank sheet of paper the same size of the inclined draughting board in front of you.  Pick up the pen and draw.  Be radical or be conformist in your design, but just draw.</p>
		<p>I think part of my lull in attitude of late is related to both the amount of games I've been playing, plus the feeling of self-worth in my work.  Whenever I get heavy into gaming, other avenues of my life become neglected. Friends, maintenance, self-esteem.  Gaming is an escape from all those and more.</p>
		<p>Watched War of the Worlds tonight.  I remember why I hate going to watch movies with the old crowd, I enjoyed the story the movie had to tell, plot holes or not, but to hear it over-analysed in a logical fashion afterwards just killed the romance in the story the movie had to tell. The human drama in this movie appealed to me more than the excellent special effects. We are a sad species. We're so individualistic we'll never be at peace with our neighbour.</p>
		<p>Anyway, I've got some reading to do. Jayesh picked up a copy of "The Alchemist" for me on my 26<sup>th</sup> birthday, I've heard so much about the book, I'll probably finish it tonight. :)</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">
