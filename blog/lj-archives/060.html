<p>A while back I set about changing the way I think, about being more upbeat and being less analytical.  (Well, being more upbeat, cos here I sit and begin being all over-analytical again.  Amazing too how I've already drawn the conclusion that being over-analytical is, well, downbeat.)</p>
<p>I've recently started to listen to my emotions, as opposed to going with thought only. I consider that my perception might be skewed by over-thought, and therefore should just "trust my gut" or "go with my heart".  Wasn't it said somewhere that thought can be wrong, but following the heart is always right?  well, applying thought to that just doesn't make sense.  So, things <em>have</em> changed, but I've noticed some side-effects that I'm not too impressed with.  One such side-effect reared it's ugly head today.</p>
<p>In an office situation, when something was wrong with the big wheel that turns, I would have adopted a "fuck-it" attitude.  I wasn't going to benefit from righting someone else's wrongs, nor would I want to.  I'd offer the least amount of effort to have the least amount of risk.</p>
<p>This time it was different.  Instead of thinking it through, I blurted out that "the big wheel is in fact... fucked".  How did I get to this situation where all reason is thrown by the wayside and emotion comes shining through like a suppurating sore?  Was it emotion that made me reason that it's fucked?</p>
<p>Whatever it was and is, I'm getting tired of the contradiction in everything.  I can't be nice without being unkind.  I can't see the good side without opposing it with the bad and vice versa, and the vice versa to the vice versa. ARGH!</p>
<p>(Off topic: I've been tasked for doing mockups that'll be presented to a client soon, instead of using "John Smith" as an example name, should I use "Peter North" instead?  What an easter-egg that will be.  I wonder if any of the client's representatives will know who he is?)</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>The walls are white and scrubbed smooth, clinical in a way.  The air is humid and delivers the scent of working humans, not that unpleasant body odour smell, but rather the smell of diligence.</p>
<p>At the front of the room, a large projector screen displays numbers in the largest possible font size.  The total wattage output.</p>
<p>Inside this large room are a number of exercise cycles aligned towards the front of the room.  Natural light pours in from the glasshouse-like roof, but the temperature is comfortable.  There is music playing.</p>
<p>The beat reaches a crescendo. Whirring undertones compliment the forward-facing attention-grabbing vocals.  People on their bikes are singing.</p>
<p>We're moving to the beat.  Cylindrical.  I feel alive.  Your rhythm matches mine, I speed up and so do you within half a beat. You're mocking me. I tire and slow down, you use the opportunity to fake-wipe the sweat from your brow while waiting for me to catch that second wind.  Always in time.</p>
<p>The sounds going through my ears propels me, as if the energy stored in a song is a catalyst for my own internal reaction.  My legs fire like pistons, plummeting the pedals down and the opposing stroke pulling the pedal up again.  Alternating, Current.  Current feeds the dynamo that is us. We're finally giving back, giving and not just taking.</p>
<p>The music is not just inside me. It is us.  We are singing. Our bodies the instrument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought about the concept of a gym being a source of energy.  A generator.  Why not replace the useless resistance on an exercise bike with a dynamo.  If you want to run a high resistance, the more power you provide.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a concept that hit the mainstream news a while back. A building was being designed that would use the energy given off by people using the stairs.  While the energy used in climbing stairs is not enough to run all the services in a building, it will have an impact, heck, even the lightbulbs illuminating the stairwells could run off the users climbing those stairs.</p>
<p>The BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5009358.stm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">published an article</a> about using the energy given off by humans in simple and elegant ways, we're not talking Matrix style harvest farms here.  Coincidentally, one of the comments raised in the article suggests gym equipment doing the same.</p>
<p>Now, how awesome was the one poster's idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My first thought is that to encourage this sort of behaviour and investment for the sprung floor electricity generation would be a night club. Surely it is not beyond someone's technical capabilities to rig up the floor to the lighting control panel. <strong>Once the power generated by the dancefloor motion reaches a certain level a synchronised light display/show commences and would continue for as long as the energy generated exceeds a certain level.</strong>"</p>
<p>Michael, Hampshire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Emphasis my own]</p>
<p>The amount of energy given would directly influence your environment, in wonderfully positive ways.</p>
<p>The question now is: "Is it more expensive in terms of energy to create and implement this technology, than just expending your energy as normal?"  How's that for capitalist thinking. :(</p>
<h4>Further research</h4>
<p>I happened across <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4900188.stm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a related article</a> on the BBC website, which made for more fascinating reading.  Sadly, I reckon the amount of energy spent getting to and from the gym would negate any energy you produced <em>for</em> the gym.  Isn't our goal then to find more efficient ways of capturing energy?</p>
<p>Isn't a small reduction in energy consumption worth it anyway?</p>

	<p>The beach is soft and the waves gentle. Walking upon the beach is a soothing and peaceful experience.</p>
	<p>I reach down towards the sand, to the crystals of silica and bits of crushed coral.  Scooping a handful up is eerily satisfying, wet sand dripping out from between my fingers.  I can only hold so much.  The harder I clench down on the sand, the more it squeezes out.  Physics.  Pressure.</p>
	<p>I know that there is more sand on the beach under my feet but I'm upset about the sand that chose to leave my hand based on my forceful and selfish actions.  Why is it than when you hold onto something tighter, it slips away?</p>
	<p>When fishing, you can catch any fish that bites but if you strike too hard on bite, something's gotta give.  The line could snap under the weight of the fish in direct opposition to the strength of the tug.  The knotting could unravel and the hook remains in the fishes gullet, poisoning the fish. Granted, you can do a catch-and-release, but that's not right.</p>

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/37768.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>Do walls need to be boring?</b></i></font><br></a> <p>How often do thoughts come to me while I'm on the shitter.</p>
<p>Whilst on the loo, and admittedly suffering from writing-withdrawal symptoms, I fantasised about spewing prose and poem all over the walls of the toilet cubicle.  I thought that such behaviour would surely get me into trouble if I was caught out.  I thought I'd need a decent permanent marker, one that wouldn't run dry.  I thought that the trouble associated with the act is more out of deviating from social norms than one of a criminal act.  I'd write about anything and everything on those walls. I'd write it brisk and strong and in ink that couldn't fade with the idle sweep of a brush or cloth.  I'd write for me and I'd write for the next potty user.  Some poems would fit within a tile, whilst others would flow over the gaps between the tiles and tell stories of anarchy and adventure leading you on to the next tile until your neck hurts from trying to take a dump and follow the story all the way to the bottom right of the loo.</p>
<p>From ceiling to floor, black ink would add character to the dull wallpaper.  The wallpaper selected for the masses.  Is my writing not like a wallpaper too?  If we were used to writing on the walls over wallpaper, would it just be another patterned wallpaper?</p>
<p>Would we suffer from an overload, an overload an autistic child deals with on a daily basis?  The walls shouting and whispering.  The voices.  Too much going on.  Would we learn to ignore it, like we currently do with the wallpaper?  Would the rare cases of art and graffiti and just-art seem trivial and mediocre and lose their effect amongst the dullness?</p>
<p>Who decides on what wallpaper to use in a public place?  Are we not subject to their mediocre-ness?  What if walls could be the wiki's of our artistic influence!  Think you can do better than the current attempt?  If so, go for it.  Walls are the whiteboards of our person.</p>
<p>I thought about the woman who lived in the Owl-House in Nieu-Bethesda, how she turned her house into the outlet for her artistic madness.  Isn't the idea of graffiti to let others see what you feel?  Why did she bottle up her urges in her little house?  Why didn't she let it go and sing her word-song to the world?</p>
<p>Now that I've written about it on my blog, I guess I can't go through with it at the office toilet cubicle.  Such is my life.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

It took me a while to get into the album as a whole, after buying it for songs like "Australia" and "Design for Life".</p>
<p>I remember humming along to such songs as "Kevin Carter", never really understanding the lyrics, which were quirky and abstract.  In fact, I never looked up the lyrics until today.</p>
<p>Now before you go and google for those lyrics, let me add a little context to this thought...</p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://socklet.blogspot.com/2007/01/series-of-tubes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Socklet Blog</a> this morning, and followed the link to the <a href="http://xmb.stuffucanuse.com/xmb/viewthread.php?tid=2589" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazing Pictures thread</a>.  Some incredible photos await within, whilst others are terribly morbid.</p>
<p>One such photo that caught my eye was one I've seen before.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/149/354023520_4cd4c4def1_o.jpg" alt="Famine in Sudan" height="544" width="502" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Now, you can see the correlation.</p>
<p>Upon reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WikiPedia entry for Kevin Carter</a> I learnt he spent a lot of his time in South Africa.</p>
<p>Imagine my train of thought when opening the picture thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Shit, these photos are amazing.  I remember some of them."</li>
<li>"That one with the vulture and the Sudanese kid... jees!" *Reads description*</li>
<li>"Kevin Carter!  Maybe that's who the Manic Street Preachers were singing about?" *googles lyrics*</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>"Jees, they used the K-word in their song and I never noticed!"</li>
<li>"I wonder if their song could have been the last straw on the camel's back for poor Kevin Carter?"</li>
<li>*does a WikiPedia lookup of Kevin Carter*</li>
<li>"Seems not, let me carry on reading..."</li>
<li>"He committed suicide at the Braamfontein Spruit! WTF, that was right outside my house in 1994!"</li>
<li>"Field and Study Centre! Double WTF!  I used to throw stones into the water there."</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if there's a lesson here.  Maybe it's important to know what you're listening to, in much the same way you know who you're voting for in an election. Maybe the ideal of overcoming ignorance is a worthy one to pursue.  Either way, it was an emotional trip this morning (probably fueled by such photos).</p>

I suspect lack of sleep, or oversleeping for the most part.  But I also think it's due to a shift in routine brought on by the short holiday.</p>
<p>Maybe all that it is, is a lack of discipline.</p>
<p>Last month I happened accross <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steve Pavlina's blog</a>.  While I used to shun such types of Self-Help articles and advice, <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the piece on being an "Early Riser"</a> spoke to me when I revisited the site this morning.  I thought back to my first month at CareerJunction.  During that time I found it easy it wake up at 5 in the morning.  In fact, when I started on the 1<sup>st</sup> of November, I remember waking just before the sun rose above the beautiful Franschhoek mountain range to the east.  A sight to behold.</p>
<p>While my original motivator was to get onto the road before 6AM to avoid the peak traffic, I found I was more motivated at work and felt alive.  Instead of my late afternoon energy kick-in, I was energetic before lunch.  Heck, I even found love! :)</p>
<p>Yesterday morning and this morning I found myself doubting why I need to get up at 5AM each morning.  I'm such a fool! :D</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/37082.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>Taming the Lion</b></i></font><br></a> <p>At 4AM this morning, the following happened...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm watching some sort of documentary. The environmental show features a single woman who bears a striking resemblance to Louise (Chronic). She's headstrong and tom-boyish yet retains that mysterious feminine touch.</p>
<p>The camera's point of view shifts now to my own eyes, as if I was the camera man.  Louise is in an enclosure attempting to placate a large male Lion.  The narrator says that Louise's hands have been damaged in a previous accident, so she doesn't really feel pain through her hands.  This is grossly evident in the way the Lion is almost chewing her hands as Louise and the Lion waltz around the paddock.  We, the viewers, are reassured that this is normal, and Louise's goal is to tame the Lion into submission.  It is only a matter of time - the Lion's inherent good nature will prevail.</p>
<p>The Lion leaves for the other end of the large paddock and Louise changes, she now looks a lot like Leigh (The-Girlfriend&trade;).  Leigh is hurt from the Lion's teeth, but is strong and handling the pain.  My view changes as I rise above the paddock, as if now I'm at a zoo and looking down into the Lion enclosure. Leigh is there at the bottom wandering around in the ankle deep mud.  She's wearing what look like Safari-shorts, Khaki maybe, and a white T-Shirt.  No shoes.</p>
<p>A black helicopter descends into the Lion pit.  My first impression is that it's my favourite Bell helicopter, the Bell 222, or Airworlf.  The chopper skillfully dodges the large tree branches over the pit and now looks like a UH-1 or Huey.  Two blades and open side-doors. I think of vietnam movies with the US mobile infantry, and how the helicopters land on the rice fields to pick up and drop off army soldiers.  Our black helicopter does exactly the same, dropping down into the mud and while still moving, Leigh jumps into the chopper which then immediately takes off.  The chopper ascends towards me, dodging the tree again on the way up.  I can't make out any pilots or crew aboard the chopper, I just know that Leigh is safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure how the dream transitioned to the new part...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've got some sort of container in my hands, and I'm taking it into the kitchen at No. 37.  The house I stayed in as a kid.</p>
<p>The container had been submerged in the garden for many years.  I open the container (which feels like a long tin) and peer inside.  It is filled with papers and leaves.  I tip it over onto the tray on the kitchen counter and pull at some of the papers.  The whole lot comes out, the papers had been a plug of sorts, cos now there are hundreds and hundreds of bugs, including cockroaches, fishmoths and beetles.  The bugs are all non-lethal but give the impression that they're unhealthy.  The bugs are now everywhere, the cockroaches are scurrying all over the counters and some are in my hair.</p>
<p>I flip out and hurredly look for the Doom in the tall grocery cupboard. The Doom is normally located at the top of the cupboard, but the top portion of the cupboard has been boarded up with plywood.  I have the distinct impression that I knew it was boarded up before, something Mom did.  The boarding up is exactly where the main power-switch is for the house, the same boarding I'm now pulling open and to the left, exposing all the wires for the distribution board.  I resist the temptation to reach inside and grab the Doom because of all the exposed wires.</p>
<p>I freak out as I feel more cockroaches in my hair.  I'm totally pissed off at my Mom for boarding up the cupboard so, and like a child have a tantrum there and then.</p>
<p>I wake up</p>

<p>A large bus stops at the gate and unloads a massive amount of toddlers and pre-teeners, followed by the old Principal of the school: Mr. Botha. The kids assemble behind me, much to my dismay and I'm visibly agitated and irritated by this event.  I confront the principal and ask him to take the children and leave.  The kids carry on lining up, as if they were starting a normal daily assembly.</p>
<p>I frog-march out to get something to eat.  Anthony (an anarchist friend from high-school) is in tow.  He seems to like the fact that I'm peeved with the proceedings.</p>
<p>The event at the school is now a full blown Carnival.  There are people everywhere, and the school buildings have been replaced with movie-studio-props of an old castle.  We venture inside the one castle room which looks like a massive mess hall inside.  There are chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling and people sitting at tavern tables enjoying their food and company.  I notice some more high-school buddies at one of the tables, the cousins: Doug and Grant. Anthony and I walk to the service counter at the end of hall and place our orders.  We try to wangle our way into getting free lunch since we were working at the Carnival but the lady behind the counter refuses.  She moves aside to let a woman of higher-authority to the front to "deal" with me.</p>
<p>At this point my frustration levels are nearing internal combustion levels.  The bossy-woman behind the counter reinforces what her servant said, so I pulled out my wildcard: Food tickets.  Only, my food tickets are actually hundreds of little coins or tokens in bank bags.  I dump them on the counter and ask for a hamburger. She frowns, the number of tokens or coins are in the smallest denomination and soon she too runs out of patience.  Anthony is silent and observant - I get the feeling he has a smirk on his face again.  The lady behind the counter crosses her arms and I give up.  I scoop up all the coins and move towards another exit.  As I pass the cousins, I throw a bank bag onto their table.  They don't see me, but I overhear them say it's from me.</p>
<p>I walk down a number of steps into what feels like a corridor to the basement or dungeon. I pass a girl from school, Nicky Seary, who was walking downstairs too, but really slow.  I'm still peeved and walking down more stairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I woke up, but dozed off again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I'm at some sort of zoo or wildlife preservation reserve.  I'm part of a tour-group being given a hands-on introduction to various South African animals.</p>
<p>The first animal is obscured, but I get the impression it's some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose" class="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mongoose</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat" class="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meerkat</a>. The Meerkat is playful, fun and adores human contact. I feel really good when in the presence of this upbeat individual.</p>
<p>Next, the guide brings over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_badger" class="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honey Badger</a> or "Ratel".  She warns the members of our group that he has a tendency to bite, so we're not allowed to pick it up. Still the tenacious badger is enjoying the attention and refrains from biting the group.  I feel slightly uneasy about the biting warning, but overall positive.</p>
<p>The "Ratel" is replaced with a cobra-like snake.  It looks exactly like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cobra" class="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cape Cobra</a>, complete with yellow-brown colours and retracted hood.  The snake never stands up straight, instead slithering around the legs of some of the completely petrified group members.  One such male-member, dressed much like a game-guide was lying down playing with the Badger. The snake encircles his lower legs and strikes him at his ankles. The bite penetrates his leather shoes.  I can't see the injury, but I get the impression that his ankle is bleeding. The main guide then questions where the snake was venomous, and after careful consideration declares that the snake was in fact a "Crystal" snake.  I've never heard of any such species before, but I understand that it's non-venomous and the "victim" will be fine.  The group breathes a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I stand up as the snake disappears and spot a baby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rhino" class="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Rhino</a> to my right.  I walk over to the calf who is encrusted in drying mud.  His skin is hard and his nature is playful too.  I try to pick off some of the caking mud from his back when I hear the guide's voice increase in panic.  The mother Rhino is charging me and the guides attempt to placate the defensive mother go unnoticed.  I step away from the calf and try dodge his mother's charge by ducking behind a tree.</p>
<p>I woke up in a cold sweat, not sure if I made it or not.</p>

<p>Pieter and I were finished with our sojourn through the mall and motioned towards the parking lot.  There was a ticketing machine as usual so we stood in the queue to pay for our parking.  Just as it was my turn to pay, I heard a scuffle to my right and a flash of clothing just outside my clear-vision-tunnel.</p>
<p>I carried on with my transaction and didn't even look to see what the commotion was about. An elderly man to my right faced me and complained: "Nobody does anything about it these days". I looked over his shoulder to see a man running away with my wallet in his hand.</p>
<p>I gave chase, the suspect was trotting at a leisurely pace, seemingly confident in his actions.  Pieter was now far behind, I was alone in the pursuit which had now slowed to a walk.  I commanded him to stop, alerting the security guards at the same time, who also turned to pursue him.  The suspect turned to face us, he was a jet-black man in his late twenties with a cap and trendy clothes on.  My first impression was that he was from upper Africa, his skin-tone and facial features typical of a Nigerian. His eyes were deep-set and sinister; immoral eyes.</p>
<p>"Give up the wallet" I reasoned.<br />The suspect responded by reaching into his pockets and pulled out a submachine gun, an Uzi.  Another jet-black man arrived alongside the primary suspect and he too reached for his Uzi.</p>
<p>"They're fake!" I exclaimed.  "Those guns are fake!".<br />"Bullshit!" retorted the primary suspect.</p>
<p>The scene that opened now can only be described as propaganda-inspired.  Halos of light surrounded the men as they lifted their weapons to the horizon.  I immediately dove for cover, a low-angle vista of these two incredible machines of communist-like hatred.  Their faces cold and uncaring.  Fire and hot-metal erupted from the business ends of their SMGs, I could hear humming, as if the noise from the guns was one of singing and not a rapid series of explosions.  They stood tall and proud, chests out like divas performing their opera.  Slowly they revolved on their standing axis and spread the fire all around, all the shots going over our heads, as if to ward us off rather than hurt and maim.</p>
<p>At this point I glanced around, taking in the environment around us.  People stood in the parking lot like mindless drones, oblivious to the crimes at hand.  I warned a tall skinny man to get down lest he get shot and he lay down behind the curb.  I turned to face the gunmen and saw them in a heap with their arms cuffed behind their backs.  Someone had managed to overpower them and cuff them whilst we were taking cover.</p>
<p>Pieter came over to me and told me the writing contained with my wallet would prove invaluable in securing justice for these two culprits. We agreed to meet up later and went our separate ways.</p>
<p>I wrote an account of the whole episode and my writing was to be used in the papers.  Pieter mentioned that it might be classified as spam, so I was reluctant to release it.</p>
<p>I woke up.</p>

<p>Being in love is an incredible experience - it's a trip! The gamut of emotions can only compliment the physical sensory overload your brain experiences.</p>
<p>Being a loner my whole life hasn't helped me being in love.  I'm still working internally like a loner, not attentive enough, not communicative enough.  I'm self-protective, always have been and struggling to work against it.</p>
<p>The other side of the good-range of emotions have been testing. Frustration, ambivalence and fear all had their parts to play.  A drama is nothing without the tragedy, right?  It's a constant learning experience, and I like learning.</p>
<p>The-Girlfriend&trade; is my teacher, my student and even my colleague. We're very similar, yet there are facets to her I wish I had. She's incredibly attentive and intricate.  Fragile in parts but centred.  She makes me realise there's more than what meets the senses to anything, especially in myself. She guides me to stop thinking too much and start feeling more. She re-taught me the simple values in life, values such as compassion and communication.</p>
<p>I learnt that touch is the opposite of being alone.  Touch people more.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/36033.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>Pass it on!</b></i></font><br></a> <p>The quest for happiness is a long and complicated one.  You have to be ready to be happy, much the same way you need to be ready to awaken.  It's not something you can just switch over to.<br />
Overcoming depression is a whole other journey before the quest for happiness.  As Jax would know, in my pursuit of happiness I decided I didn't have to be depressed anymore.  Why be depressed, when you can be happy?  Depression is addictive in many ways, but so too is happiness.</p>

<p>I was thinking last night (whilst filling up my car) that I should share a tip for being more upbeat.</p>

<p>I think one of the primary ways to be happy is to surround yourself with happy people.  While happiness is a deeply internal feeling, it can be influenced by external factors - We're emotional beings afterall (well, most of us :P).  Music can shift your mood instantly.<br />
So, back to happy people.  I've recently been getting a buzz from the man and woman in the street, the average Joe. I used to be quite uncomfortable around strangers, especially people who come out of the shadows of your awareness and into the spotlight for brief periods.  Case in point: Petrol Attendants.<br />
These guys (and in rare cases: ladies) work the worst hours, get paid peanuts and probably have to deal with some seriously grumpy people.  Picture it, they walk over from the shop area, expecting the same thing they've come to expect.  Very rarely have I come across a petrol attendant who has a genuine smile on his face.<br />
So, instead of waiting for them to pep me up, I try.</p>

<p>I start with greeting them in their native tongue. (Thankfully it is relatively easy in the Cape to recognise a Xhosa person, as it's the most used black language down here.)<br />
"Molo!" I say with a smile.  Instinctively, their answer is "Hello".  Then a small smile creeps in as they realise this white boy in front of them made the effort to communicate in their home tongue. I ask them how they are. "Khunjani?!".  Now at this point, the mini-conversation can go two ways. Either they'll enthusiastically rattle off in Xhosa about anything and everything and I won't understand, Or they'll revert to English or Afrikaans.
If the latter, I ask them to teach me a Xhosa word, any Xhosa word.  My pronounciation isn't too sharp, but that makes it all the more fun. <br />
If the former, I respond with: "Haibo! Undie-yaaaz" (pronounced that way - don't ask me how it's spelt! :P) which, when translated means: "Gosh!  I don't understand." heh. (see: <a href="http://www.learnxhosa.com/mp3s.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Learn Xhosa: MP3s</a>)</p>

<p>I learnt this trick when in Mexico with Gareth and Mandy.  One of the first afternoons there, I'd walk up to the bar and ask in English for another beer.  Most of the poor mexicans behind the bar would get the beer with a blank look on their face.  Something a robot could do.<br />
Gareth suggested we learn some basic spanish and start using it.  Advice that proved priceless.<br />
The next time I needed a topup, I walked up to the bar and said: "Beunos tardes!  Uno cerveza por favor".  The smile effect was addictive.  I drank a lot of Corona and Margerhitas in Mexico :)</p>

<p>To sum it up, don't wait for others to cheer you up.  Make them smile and in so doing, you too will feel happy. :)</p>

<p>I'm realising now, that reading all those self-help articles on managing depression make points very similar to those I've outlined already.  Amazing how you don't actually see something when you don't look for it.  Simple tips like smiling, so difficult when depressed, and yet so easy to do.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

Electrical energy, a spark of static bridges the gap, earthed by you and your touch, the touch that is more than just tactile. It is transmitting something else too, an undercurrent of emotion and icebergs of love, their crowns visible above the surface. The surface of us.  So much more within the water.  So much more that just a sight, it is the smell of the exposed and the sound of the melting. The melting of us.</p>
<p>I take you in my arms, effortless, we're floating.  We're made to fit. You're holding on tight now, not out of insecurity but out of the need to be closer. You're already close, but when you hold me like that I feel so much closer.</p>
<p>We're ascending now, twirling upwards and taken by the wind. The wind through your hair and clothes, tickling you until the hairs on your arms reach out and ask for more.  Your eyes are alive with intrigue and the secret fire burning inside you.  Our vision is locked, our dream is alive. We're riding the dream, guided by the wind.  Our sails in full bloom, accelerating towards the horizon.</p>
<p>You awaken the power within me to fly.</p>

<p>
"Being awake is a metabolic state which is marked by catabolic processes and which is characterized by consciousness, the opposite of sleep, an anabolic process. Communication, ambulation, and ingestion are normally conducted while awake, though they have been known to happen during sleep. Animals can run, walk and eat while awake; humans can also talk, listen, write, read, and productively think and work in the awake state."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sleeping is a good thing right?  Sleeping is a restorative process, a resyncing of the self with the world. Sleeping has one major drawback, you're not awake and experiencing life.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm accelerating towards awakening.  It's not a falling type of acceleration, like gravity, it's more an ascension.  A powerful rocket accelerating upwards. Up there is blissful freedom.</p>

<p>When you buy a new car, or get a fancy new shirt, do you notice how many of the same cars there are on the road like your new car?  Do you walk past people in the shops and notice they're wearing the same shirt as you?  (depends where you shop for cars and shirts, right? :P)<br />
Aren't your eyes open to those things that interest you?</p>

<p>Isn't the world going through an awakening, a spiritual awakening? Or is that just my perception since I feel like I'm awakening, and I'm seeing that awakening in others and the world around me? </p>

<p>The last 3 years (and maybe even further back) have been a primer for what I'm going through now.  Just like in stages of sleep, you need to be ready to be awake.  Your body eases into your conscious state.  You could be startled awake at any stage but you'd talk incoherently or stumble over your own toes - you won't be ready.<br />
Little things along the way, like being complimented, and trying new things have been great contributing factors to this awakening.<br />
Right now, I'm thinking of Jayesh, how he made me aware of the untapped power within all of us.  He rekindled dreams in me that I thought I'd lost.  He made me realise there's more to life than the norm.<br />
Even buying my Wagoon has made me more aware.  Travelling, the great metaphor for life, was so much more fun when you can pull more G's through a turn, each wheel as if it was firmly aligned on a rail, the engine thirsty for more air and giving so much more.  I am Shaun cos I'm smiling.

<p>The move to Cape Town too was a positive step and the following of an omen.  Just as Santiago learnt to follow omens, I followed mine.  The move to Cape Town just felt and still feels right.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>I met her at the train station I was never meant to stop at.</p>
<p>The train screeched to a halt.  Handbags and brollies rocketed down from various locations within the cab as I struggled to maintain my hold on the silver isle pole.  The smell of freshly welded metal, the smell of averted disaster.<br />
Most of the passengers remained unscathed in the brutal attack of their senses.  The train suffered no collision, just a few flustered heart-rates amongst the survivors and a murmur before the crying started.<br />
I stumbled out the emergency doorway and took the service-walkway to the station landing just ahead.  There, onlookers gasped and recounted the story to those not privileged enough to see the event with their own eyes.</p>
<p>A woman in her late twenties stepped forward from the group.<br />
"Are you alright!?!" She gaped.<br />
"I think so" I said.  "Can you help me assist the other passengers?"<br />
"Why... um, yeah, sure!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>I slowly turned for the train in the tunnel.<br />
<p>An explosion of senses erupted from her hand as she grabbed my shoulder. I was both bouncing with joy and crying morbid tears typically left for the passing of a loved-family member.  I was flying at will and dragging myself through the mud.  Flashes of light and memories before my eyes.<br />
Everything faded to black as I collapsed in a heap, my brain overloaded from the total onslaught of senses.</p>
<p>I was sleeping.</p>
<p>When I came to, I was being lifted by two medics onto a stretcher.  Apparently I had passed out next to the rails. I tried to sit up in the stretcher, look past my legs, between the two medics at my feet and there it was, the tunnel.  Empty.  No train.  No people.  My head hurt.</p></blockquote> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>I was browsing a set of photos and came across something I thought I had to share with my younger brother Mike.</p>
<p>It was series of clips taken out on the ocean on a foggy day.  There in the still water was a craggy rock, just exposed enough for a gang of gulls to perch upon it. In the series of pics, the water was visibly surging to the right of this gull encrusted rock until the last pic, which was filled with a total white-wash of water.  Seemingly obliterating the gulls too, but it felt as if they were OK and managed to take off in time.</p>
<p>I called Mike over to show him the hysterical nature of the photos and started the slideshow. Mike and I were instantaneously transported to the water, where we waded long enough to see the slideshow before our own eyes.  It was even more spectacular in person.  Catching our breaths from all the laughter, we decided to turn and make for the coast (which, based on the direction of the wave was now in front of us.)  We couldn't see anything through the thick fog, a fog which seemed to blend the colour of the ocean with that of the sky above. </p>
<p>Mike wasn't swimming very well in the warm water, so he clung on to my left foot as I swam with the waves towards the coast (which had to be there).  Slowly the rocky coastline emerged from the fog and we were well within reach.  I had a distinct impression there were sharks in the water, so I looked down into the water and lo and behold, circling Great Whites!  They were juvenile sharks, not more than 2 meters long.  But they were there, and circling still.</p>
<p>I encouraged Mike to remain calm and just to carry on paddling, we were almost there. The sharks knew this too and just as I reached for the nearest rock on the coast, I felt Mike's grip on my left ankle subside.  I woke up.</p>

			<p>Shut up, just shut up!  We don't need to talk.  I'm just as comfortable here in this silence, this silence filled with the sight of your smile and your smell.  Smell is not the word, smell is harsh.  Fragrance is false and scent... now scent is close but not perfect.  Scent is primal and basic.  If you could mix scent with something like the way you breath deeply in my ear, that would be the word. Your hot breath in my ear.  It drives me fucking insane and you know it.  It's your leash over me, but a leash that is comfortable.  No pain involved, just like silk.  A silken leash that gestures and doesn't pull. You're amazing to me.</p>
			<p>I close my eyes and imagine the lights are out. I know you're close, but I can't feel you. I can feel you, but I can't touch you.  That's a six sense we have.  A sense for presence. Picking up energy, boundless energy that awaits to fuel internal fires.  Internal fires, how lusty of you to think. I'm talking about internal fires that fuel more than the engine room and keep the lights on in the cabin. The fires that keep the music playing and the little people aboard this vessel smiling.  I can't say boats - just a vessel.</p>
			<p>But you're not here, and I'm not here either. I feel like I've been preparing my whole life for the time that I will spend with you.  I've disciplined my mind, but I know that no preparation can prepare me for when I am with you. I don't need to prepare, because the mistakes I make will be as important as the gestures and the fact that I'm just being me and you're totally into it.  Maybe that's what I want. To be accepted. My faults will be anchoring points as strong as the strengths I offer. That rock in the road is there to make the car bump, not puncture the tyre. </p>
