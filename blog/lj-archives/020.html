<p>I've gone cold turkey.  Yesterday, I hung out my last <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EVE Online</a> character to dry.  I've slowly been weening myself off gaming in general, prompted primarily by a lifestyle change and I'm feeling all the better for it.</p>
<p>All that free time has lead to me reading a lot of books recently.  I even started an <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/ndorfin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">online catalog of my books</a> by using <a href="http://www.librarything.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LibraryThing</a>.  Recent gems include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kite_Runner" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Kite Runner</a> - Khaled Hosseini</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spud_%28novel%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spud</a> - John van de Ruit</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ender's Game</a> - Orson Scott Card</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been mountain-biking semi-regularly, but haven't been to gym for like 3 weeks.  Bad bad.</p>
<p>Emotionally, I'm feeling much more self-assured.  It's a great feeling actually.  I'm content.</p>
<h4>Shock, Horror, Gasp!</h4>
<p>On the work side, I'm finally feeling like I belong at this company.  I'm being given plenty of opportunities to show what I'm made of, and my colleagues seem to be happy with my work.</p>
<p>Neil recently left the company though, which is a major hit to our small Python web-app team of 4.  There seems to be a general shortage of competent Python Developers in SA, which is a pity, since it's such a great language to work with.  Genshi on Python is fantastic.</p>
<p>We're looking to hire a User Interface developer soon.  Someone we could either mentor into doing more front-end web dev work, or hire someone who does that kinda work everyday.  Job ads to follow.</p>
<p>And, muggins here is going to be overseeing the company's first User Testing experience.  It's great to finally put into practice that which I've researched for the last 2 years.</p>
<h4>The end?</h4>
<p>A lot of my blogging habits have been forged by venting.  My livejournal has been used less and less since I seem to be getting happier?   I need to look at starting a professional blog.  Interesting times lie awaiting.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

	<p>I was warned about you.  You came bruised with caution stickers as I pulled you out the box.  Chevrons in loud colours, heck, you even smelt of danger and I liked it.</p>
	<p>The packing fluff was quickly removed and cast aside.  Something didn't feel right, but my fears were cast aside when the last layer of plastic melted away and I caught sight of you.

	<p>You're an action figure, limited movement, battery operated.  On the outside you seem quite complicated, but you're really very simple. You're assembled by starving chinese children.</p>
	<p>Just like any toy, your lifetime is limited.  By the time you realise those that hold you have outgrown you, you're gonna be scratched, missing arms and legs and if you're lucky, given to the dog to play with.</p>
	<p>But that doesn't feel right.  Why was I even given such a toy?  Why does this feeling of wrong seem to follow you?  Maybe some toys are real people inside.  Maybe some people have hearts and consider others.  Maybe those people who consider others don't play with others as if they're toys.</p>

It was hosted at <a href="http://www.relish.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Relish</a> in town.</p>
<p>After having been invited to the <a href="http://www.geekdinner.org.za/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GeekDinner</a> recently by <a href="http://www.bryndivey.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bryn</a> and <a href="http://nxsy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neil</a> and enjoying it, I had high-expectations of the 27Dinner, since the concept is the same.  The concept is loosely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take in the surrounds and ambience of a decent restaurant</li>
	<li>Mingle with like-minded people and network</li>
	<li>Share good wine and good food</li>
	<li>And most importantly, get 1 or more participants to stand up and talk briefly about IT topics they're passionate about (No-one has talked about porn yet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Relish is a pretty shnazzy venue.  The 27Dinner gathering was hosted on the top floor, offering great views of Table Mountain and surrounds. 100 people booked, and a similar figure arrived to cram the rather small space.  Listening to the speakers was equally daunting.</p>
<p>Most of the attendees were standing, since there was very little space to sit.  The sound quality from the PA system was horribly obscured by the acoustics and general chatty noise from the attendees. (Some of which decided it was better to carry on talking through the presentations).</p>
<p>On the plus side, I spent some time with Benny and Ernst, learnt a lot about <a href="http://www.reflex-nutrition.com/sports_nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reflex</a>, and managed to hear Henk talk about User Experiences and <a href="http://www.webaddict.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rafiq</a> talk about himself (and a little TED). :P</p>
<p>I left pretty soon after Rafiq's talk. My back was killing me from standing for 2 hours.</p>
<h4>Those Marketing People</h4>
<p>Marketing people actually talk in <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> and of course CAPS <em>and ANY <strong>variation</strong> there-of</em>.  It was as tiring as <a href="http://maxkaizen.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reading their blogs</a> (Sorry Max, you'll be the poster-marketing-girl today for overuse of font-style).</p>
<p>They're a different crowd to us geeks (I better be careful now, apparently that's a sore topic from the last 27Dinner :P) which is probably why you'll find me at the next GeekDinner and not the next 27Dinner.</p>
<p>Thanks must go to <a href="http://www.daveduarte.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dave Duarte</a> who did all the organising.  I know from personal experience what a thankless task it is setting up such things.  I'd suggest putting a lower cap on the number of attendees or organise another projector for downstairs?</p>

I was standing outside English Class, waiting for the ever-PMSing Ms. Wilkinson to arrive.  She was late again.  As bored students do, we huddled and talked shit.</p>
<p>Preston Rogers, one of those quietly brilliant types and fellow pupil reached into his bag and handed me a wrinkly copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty_Four" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>.  "Read it" he commanded.  Just like a greedy dwarf gobsmacked by glitter, I failed my wisdom check and accepted the book.</p>
<h4>Later that night...</h4>
<p>It was usually after 8PM after making tea for the family.  I'd elope to my room instead of watching SABC news all over again for the third time.</p>
<p>After my parents retired to their own bedroom, I'd hear Dad's voice.  He was arguing.  He wasn't arguing - He was demeaning, shouting down my Mom.  My Mom wouldn't say anything.  I imagined how she'd just sit there and take the bouts of verbal abuse.</p>
<p>"the clock struck thirteen".  "smells of cabbage".  The first few chapters immediately set a depressive tone.  I was 16, overcome by hormones and a wretched moroseness.  A few nights later I gave up.  The shadowy world of Oceania was a little too close to home.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to give Preston his book back.  But something lingered.</p>
<p>Two years later and I finished School and Mom and Dad separated.</p>
<h4>One month ago</h4>
<p>Mom bought me a brand new copy of Nineteen Eighty-Four for my birthday.</p>
<h4>Earlier this week</h4>
<p>...I finished it. 12 years later and I've finally finished it. Orwell is a twisted-genius, and the curse has been lifted.  Preston, thanks.  I think.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/46789.html'><font color="" face="Arial"><i><b>Roll on</b></i></font><br></a> <p>The changes I've gone through the last month would take an enitre LJ entry to explain, oh look, I'm typing it out already...</p>
<p>Ahh, that's better - music fills the void, bounces off these walls.  Tool.</p>
<h4>Cost of living</h4>
<p>My bank balance has been hovering around the breaking-even marker, moving to Cape Town has been... costly.</p>
<p>When I saw the trend emerging, I set about changing 2 of 3 possible things. Getting a more cost-effective vehicle or moving closer to work.  In the end, I got both.</p>
<h4>Trading material attachments</h4>
<p>I traded in my pegasus for a horse. Goodbye nDwagon. Hello Polio.  Maybe I shouldn't be so mean about my new car.  It is as much an enabbler as my last car, but it just feels stunted. (Hence the name Polio.) Like anyone with a chronic ailment will tell you, you certainly learn to appreciate what you have (and not have).</p>
<p>Truth be told, the new car is great.  It's light on fuel (I'm already getting double the mileage), it's trustworthy and it's soft. The Scooby was hard and demanding, like a wild horse.  The new car is a timid pony, but one that won't nip at your ankles, rub you off against a tree or throw you off so that you break your back.</p>
<p>It was high time I got a new car, especially since I was altering my behaviour by avoiding driving the Scooby too much.  I carpooled with the boss (and that's not good for perceptions at the office - people thought I was the teachers pet or something.)  Heck, I even made excuses not to drive into town, to avoid driving the N1 in a gas-guzzling sports-car.</p>
<h4>The new place</h4>
<p>While I was searching (and doing my homework) for a new car, I was also looking for a place closer to work.  I met strange people in their homes, fantasised about being open minded enough to live with a vegetarian, heck, even thought I'd be able to tolerate a religious zealot just to live closer to work.  Oh the things we do for work.  Maybe spending an average of 12 hours per day put out by work was clawing away at my subconscious, to the point I snapped?</p>
<p>I found out a friend of mine had recently moved down to Cape Town and was also looking for a place to share.  The only reason I found out, was because he shares my birthday, and after trading pleasantries he called.  He'd been looking for a place for 2 weeks already, and had heard of a new lead in Gardens / Vredehoek.  We went to check the place out.  It looked good, except for the single bathroom thing.  I felt confident about the place, but it was missing some finality from the Landlord.  She was apparently considering another application from a member of her church.</p>
<p>I got an e-mail a few days later from this friend of mine, saying something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dewd, I've been praying to God for the right person to move in with, and it seems my prayers have been answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I'm thinking he's taking the spiritual avenue downtown, happy to move in to a place.  Turns out, I got duped. He's dropped me, in favour of someone else he hasn't met, based on said person's religious outlook.</p>
<p>I was peeved. He phoned to explain and all I wanted was an apology, which came after the prompt.</p>
<p>I rolled on, back on to <a href="http://www.gumtree.co.za" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gumtree.co.za</a> and found another advert.  Turns out it was for a place just down the road from the office in Kenilworth. That's how I met Elmarie and Dale.</p>
<h4>And?</h4>
<p>It's been good so far.  Kinda bored though. No PC, no TV.  What do bored people do?  At least I finally got my mountain bike fixed. :P</p>
<p>Anyway, one more major thing to change.  Watch this space.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

	<p>The sound of the wind. Wooing me. Calling me back to where I was before. Trees and their leaves, dipping their fingers in the water-like wind. Waking the water.</p>
	<p>The shape of your finger under a stream of cold water.  The day is hot.  You could drink for days.  Endless supply of water.  Watch how the water turns the soil dark and muddy. The overgrown grass on the edge of the pool of water.  So much greener than the grass under your feet.  Tickling your feet, softly.</p>
	<p>The sun is out and showing off again.  My skin rejuvenated and feeling healthy. I'd throw the frisbee into the wind and let it throw it back to me. The way it dips and rises in the air currents, a force far beyond mine.</p>
	<p>You should be like that - simple gestures with the greatest of meaning. The way water rolls off our hands, but still feels wet. Isn't water just poking holes through the air?  Aren't we actually underair and water is like bubbling through it?  Stand upside down in the pool and put your feet in the air. Aren't you standing in the air now?  How can perspective be so misleading.  So much for Intelligent Design, more like: Inspired Design.</p>

	<li>I read your e-mail, you said terrible things about me.  I'm not surprised.  I am surprised that I actually care about what you said about me.</li>
	<li>I'm upset that I'm being negative at work. I'm upset that the only thing people see in me at work is my negativity.  You're all so negative too.</li>
	<li>I see right through you.  Your weakness, your words bounce off my bullshit shield.  Why do I care?  Cos you're the captain of this ship, and we're all doomed.  The engine room reports that we're running out of fuel.</li>
	<li>I'm a girly fan for Chris Cornell. If I ever managed to sing, it would be like him.  If I cut my hair and wore blue contact-lenses, I'd look like him.</li>
	<li>I hate the way people can't just say it like it is.  If you have a problem with me, then say it.  Get it off your chest and make it aware to me.  Remember, I read your e-mail.</li>
	<li>I'm secretly hoping that my change in car and home will ease my mind a little.</li>
	<li>Hypocrisy is all around us.  Mea culpa.</li>

<p>If you were given the chance to lead a happier life, but to do so, you'd not be as intelligent as you were before, you wouldn't know you were intelligent, Would you take it?  Forget the blue or red pill stuff - Think for real.</p>
<p>Basically, you'd be sacrificing intelligence for happiness.  Is that a reasonable exchange?</p>
<p>Are intelligent people happy?</p>
<p>Are happy people ignorant?</p>
<p>What of the emotionally intelligent?  If you understand others, or empathise with others, can you be happy?</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<p>My party and I are running through a snow-laden wood.  There are three of us.  We each possess unique talents, superhuman abilities as well as the ability to stop time.</p>
<p>Our pursuers are three big cats, a lioness or sabre-tooth tiger, a white leopard and a dark cat - a gray puma perhaps.</p>
<p>For some reason we're running in a large figure of eight, and each time we reach the centre of the figure, the cats come in from the left, so one of us stops time and we leap over them.</p>
<p>The cats carry on from left to right, stuck in their own pattern of pursuit.</p>
<p>After briefly opening the distance to the cats, I stop in my tracks to see two owls in the path.  The one on the right is healthy, but the one on the left has a torn-stub for a right wing.  It pleads with me to help it.</p>
<p>I lift both owls up and put the healthy one on my right shoulder and the injured one on my left shoulder.  I'm now quite far behind my party-members so I try make up the difference.</p>
<p>We reach a massive cliff, I can see islands and trees in the water down below, and a large mountain of stone across the other side of the water.  I tell the owls to hold on and I jump off the cliff and glide down to the water.  I land in the water, which is only knee-deep, but I'm concerned about getting the owls wet.</p>
<p>I wade in the water towards a wooden decking, the water is warm and feels like soup.  There is algae and moss hanging on the trees and the wooden deck.  Rumours of pirates and death fill the air.</p>
<p>A large, snake-like animal swims past my legs, I can feel it brush against my feet.  I can only make out a blurry silhouette in the water.  These marshes are infested.  I climb up onto the decking and can see the towering cliffs on either side of me, I'm not sure I can fly up there now.  The dream ends.</p>
