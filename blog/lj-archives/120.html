		<p>I was sitting on the pavement, legs in the street after another full day at work.  It was 8ish, the sun was setting.  I plugged in my iPod and played some Staind.</p>
		<p>What transpired for the next 15 minutes was truly surreal.  I felt like I was in one of those scenes in a movie, the wind blew briskly, my face warmed by the light of the setting sun and this song, serenading the emotional uprising inside me.</p>
		<p>There was nothing more to it, except these overwhelming feelings of both ethereality and sadness.  Not sure if the music itself had any effect in worsening my emotional situation, but it sure went with the rhythym of that moment.  I felt like crying and smiling at the same time.  So I had this blank yet relfective expression on my face.</p>
		<p>My lesson had been learnt though, it was good for me.  Walking into any encounter with expectations is really bad, especially when those expectations are not met to the full.</p>
		<p>Still I felt terrible about the whole thing, especially about my own feelings.  I was cross with her, but it had no foundation in her actions, rather in my own.  I felt rejected through my own actions.  She wasn't the one turning me down, it was my own expectations slapping me through the face.</p>
		<p>This last week in Natick was bad, but it proved to me that popping a question is totally worth the risk.  My time spent with her was considerably better than wasting away behind a computer :)</p>
		<p>BTW, the song was "Staind - Epiphany".</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/23748.html'></a> <h3>New beginnings, always exciting :)</h3>
		<p>I started an entry earlier today but for some reason I left it blank. Now it's time to fill it with some juicy goodness.</p>
		<p>Some of you know me well enough to know I'm a tad too timid to try anything in the female relations department.  Today was different.  Today I popped a casual coffee-date proposal to someone who makes me tickle inside.</p>
		<p>Picture this, I'm pacing back and forwards in my little hotel room, thinking about how best to approach the situation.  I thought up outrageous plans, except maybe the one about serenading at her window.  The only musical instrument I can play is a rhythym stick. So, I hopped onto MSN for advice from an online bud, the Almighty_1. :D  He didn't help me much, but he pointed me in the agreeable right direction.  After much deliberation I was off with a plan!</p>
		<p>Boldly I paced down the stairs, room key and 10 dorra in hand. The plan was something like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Acquire primary target, codename: "Ice Cream" from Hotel lobby fridge.</li>
			<li>Pay for said Ice Cream at the front desk, as is common practice, where our intended lass, code-name: "J" works.  All the while avoiding detection.</li>
			<li>Scope for enemy hostiles, and move in to broadcast distance.</li>
			<li>Send encoded signal to "J", acquire response and vacate the area before Charlie arrives.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In reality, it went something like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Successfully picked out an ice-cream flavour from the fridge.</li>
			<li>Waited in the queue for my chance to pay for the ice cream.  Agent "J" was nowhere to be seen. Area was swarming with enemy hostiles. (I assumed Agent J had been discovered and taken into enemy custody).  Reverted to Plan B.</li>
			<li>Left a short message with Agent J's sidekick.</li>
			<li>Charlie arrived, so I bolted.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>and then...</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Agent J contacted me over the wired transceiving antenna.  I play dumb, assuming the enemy could be listening in to our very converation.</li>
			<li>I forgot a frikkin spoon for the ice cream!</li>
			<li>I tell Agent J I will rendezvous with her at the Lobby, ETA: 1 min.</li>
			<li>Agent J points me in the direction of the pickup.</li>
			<li>Once again, the area was swarming with hostiles.  I decided not to send the signal.</li>
			<li>I vacated the area and hurried off to the extraction point.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Frustrated, I was left with only one option. Phone her. Screw those commie bastards if they listen in, I've got to speak to her, alone! So, I dialled guest services.</p>
		<p><em>*riiiing riiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p><em>*riiiing riiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p><em>*riiiing riiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p><em>*riiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p>Aside: "Oh noes, she's got my room number on her phone terminal!  She's ignoring me!"</p>
		<p><em>*riiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p>Aside: "Why doesn't she answer!"</p>
		<p><em>*riiiiiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*</em></p>
		<p>*click* I hung up the phone. I try busy myself with opening the ice cream...  then my phone rings.</p>
		<p>At this point when I answer the phone, I bet she could hear me smiling over the phone :)</p>
		<p>"Coffee?" Her tone curious. "Sure!  How about tomorrow!" She says.  With a "woohoo" inside, I agreed and took down her number.</p>
		<p>Right now, I'm typing this out, trying to eat rock-hard ice cream with a smile so wide. The ice cream is OK, but it doens't matter how good or bad it tastes, it's the best damn ice cream I've ever bought!</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I was staring out the window of our Canadair RegionalJet on our way back to a stormy Boston, The following happened:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Peering down, the surface cloudy from laden moisture.  The soft cold air coating my nostrils with a freshness.  Below the patch surface. There are lights below. Lights shimmering in the murk below.  If I reach out, I dream I can touch this invisible surface but reason is telling me it is not there.  Still, I sit here, way up here, looking down and imagine ripples in my past.  Ripples distorting this invisible surface.  Ripples bouncing the dying sunlight in every direction.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It was a stressful week at the client's offices in Georgetown, MD.  A logistical pain-in-the-ass. The return car journey to the return flight was to be expected, but we arrived at the airport on turn.  We were greeted with a security search queue that almost went out the terminal doors back into the parking lot. Tensions heightened.  We raced to the gate after being cleared by security only to find out our flight to Boston was to be delayed. For two whole hours. God bless america.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>I found myself involved in an internal dilemna while travelling from my hotel room to the hotel cafe: "Why can't the entrance to the stairs be closer to the elevator?"</p>
		<p>So much laziness in this country, but is it also efficiency?  It probably takes me less time to scale the stairs to the 3rd (err, fourth) floor than to wait and take the elevator. If the entrane to the stairs was closer to the lobby it would be even faster, but then why am I taking the stairs in the first place?</p>
		<p>I think its to do some exercise rather than being a truly lazy git and taking the elevator. So why am I moaning about having to walk further just to get to the stairs? heh.</p>
		<h3>...do as the romans do</h3>
		<p>Work is bad here.  The company is a new, red-tape-tied-down beast that could easily rival big brother in clinical extremeity towards its own employees or "resources".  I feel like the red-tape-rogue here, an outsider, free-thinking rebel.</p>
		<p>This is corporate cubicle america.  It is cold, unforgiving and clinical.  I look forward to flying home.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>Some of you may recall this blog entry: <a href="http://ndorfin.blogspot.com/2005/01/ive-missed-you-why-dream-i-had-this.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dreaming about boston and lost loves</a>. Well, the weirdest thing happened today.</p>
		<p>If you didn't know already, I'm in Boston as I'm typing this :) This time for 2 weeks on a short business project.  Anyway, from that last link, you'll notice the bit:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I'm here to collect M's great aunt. We arrive in Boston, but the airport doesn't look familiar. Instead, I'm getting a documentary overview of the city, as if I was watching a tourist information clip about the city.</p>
			<p>M's aunt and I are on a weird jerking tram system, it makes all the old ladies on it feel uncomrfortable, yet they know they're safe because they've done it so many times before. M's aunt is rattling off to me, telling me of many things, but I'm not paying attention, maybe even ignoring her. The tram weaves thru strange unknown parts of Boston and at one point all the old women aboard time it perfectly: They throw bread out the tram's open air windows into a lake which is already covered in soggy bread and a multitude of white and patchy geese.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Well, picture this. I've just spent 21 hours travelling from JHB to BOS, and as I step off the airplane walkway, I'm greeted with a huge photo spread on the wall.</p>
		<p>The poster is of swans in a pond, below a bridge and a backdrop I distinctly remember from my dream.  I stood there, gobsmacked.  So, I took out the camera and took a snap.  Unfortunately it didn't come out very well :(</p>
		<p>I suspect the photo was there last time we landed in Boston, and I subconciously noted it. Weird how the brain can play back things.</p>
		<h3>Re-tracing steps</h3>
		<p>The bus trip to the terminal in Framingham brought back both excellent and bad memories alike. Its good to be back here actually.</p>
		<p>I'm gonna be in Boston for a few days, then a team of us is heading over to Maryland, VA, for some project scoping.  That should last a week.</p>
		<p>Its now 5:45PM, I'm waiting for 6PM so I can scoot downstairs and grab something to eat before I die.</p>
		<p>Feed the cats for me, and don't forget to switch off the lights before you leave every morning.  I'll be home soon honey, love you lots.</p>
		<p>Gratz to Jay on his 28th. Sorry I missed it. :(</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Fog settles over the water.  Obscurity before vision, impairing primary senses.<br />
				The water is eeringly still, not even wavelets lapping at the sides of the boat.<br />
				A smell of rotting rests upon the water, it is sickening. As if the water had been stagnant for months, no new life, not even in the byproducts of the cycleless festering.<br />
				The captain is hesitant, visible unsure of his own actions.  I pity the fool. He's leading us all to our doom.<br />
				He bends his head, listening intently. That's all we have out here, the sounds and the gut. Noses are clogged with decay, eyes milky with the veil drawn in front of them and nothing but the taste of a dry, parched mouth.<br />
				What is that fool listening for?  Or, worse, what is he listening to! He's listening like the lives on this fate-weighted vessel depend on his two last remaining senses. Listening, for the call of doom.<br />
				Why doesn't he just use his gut? Why don't we throw anchor and wait for the fog to rise?  I sense he's been here before, in this same situation.  Maybe this captain is not so much a fool as he is our saviour.<br />
				I hear it!  Its beautiful!  A voice, like ambrosia, sweetly deadly. Where is it coming from? She loves me!  She loves me alone! Her song makes her dreamingly intriguing, creating images of serenity, untainted splendour.<br />
				I must find this voice, find the origin of this honey for ears, find the source of this pleasure forthcoming. She is so close, I can almost feel her.  Feel her breath on my neck and in my ear, prickling the hairs on my anticipative skin like a cold, fresh wind.<br />
				Where is she?  Why does she sing so? She's lonely!  She's hurt!  I must help her.  She's in danger.  I'm coming!  I'll save you!<br />
				The captain hears her too.  He wants her all to himself. I won't let him.<br />
				Captain, why do you draw your musket?<br />
				Put it down, or I'll gut you, you selfish seadog.  She's mine.  She only loves me.<br />
				Captain, why did you pull the trigger?<br />
				I'm bleeding, my hand extended before me is warm from the blood running down my arm.<br />
				Before it fades to black, I realise that the fog has lifted, revealing our collective doom.<br />
				Our captain, you saved me from a guilt ridden hell, but you have cursed yourself by taking my life. Thank you.<br />
				The light fades, eyelid's close.  I smile as I realise I can hear the wavelets caressing the soft belly of our boat once again.  Such a soothing sound it is. I could fall asleep to this rhythym. Sleep and dream, and never wake.

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href='https://ndorfin.livejournal.com/22325.html'></a> <h3>Cruising at thirty-five thousand</h3>
		<p>So I got a chance to type a bit, everytime I fly to Cape Town I think of one particular night on a lengthy bus trip to the Cape, overnight.  The bus was cruising along, a new bus, smoothly.  The sun had set as we left the bus terminal in Johannesburg, we were now just past Kimberley.</p>
		<p>The moon was out in its full glory, lighting up the karoo with an eerie glow, like there was a huge filter over the sun, or wearing 4 pairs of sunglasses at the same time.  Picture it, the shrubbery whizzing by, just outside the bus, my head in the openness of the window and the wide panoramic view it afforded.  That moonlight squashed all the stars out the night sky it was so intense.</p>
		<p>So, why I am I heading down to Cape Town?  Well, the primary reason is to attend one of South Africa's first Web Standards related conferences or forums. The tied first would have to be to see Mom and Patrick :)</p>
		<p>Work hasn't been going well.  There are so many ideals and dreams not realised at the office.  It's just a routine again, something I detested when I worked at Dimension Data.  Maybe I need a change.</p>
		<p>Part of me is thinking I need to just get out of here.  To run away and do something totally offbeat.  One of the ideas was to help out in some volunteer organisation, you know, do something like help a biological research team in deepest darkest africa, or visit a foreign country, learn a foreign language and be a foreigner for a year or two.</p>
		<p>But then I am reminded of the typical thinking, Buy a house, marry, have kids, raise them to do the same.  That sounds so, erm, typical.  I keep thinking, why is it neccesary to make money?  Maybe thats the reason for wanting to disappear, is to understand that money is not everything.  I want to wake early in the mornings, work for my food and lodging and enjoy doing it.</p>
		<p>Radical.</p>

			<p>Bluesy Betty was an enormous woman. She was that graceful yet extremely lazy elephant of a woman.</p>
			<p>Every Monday, Wednesday and especially Fridays she had a gig at the corner Blue Foundation Cafe in down-town Chicago.  Life for Betty on the outside was a glorious affair one of soulful rhythyms, huge smiles and glorious tones.  Inside, she was unhappy, a hopeless dreamer singing her lonely call three times a week.  This inner beauty shone through when she sang, it had meaning, loaded with experience.</p>
			<p>Slim-Joe and Earl, two ungainly characters were Betty's entourage.  One a double-bass plucker, the other, a keyboard dabbling monkey, both hell bent on finding that perfect vibe to bring out Betty's soul, that soul that kept the crowds coming back, session after session.  There were always the fascinated regulars at the cafe, but for the most part the cafe earned its exceptional revenue from over-priced bourbons served to the dollar swinging tourists. 3 times a week, Betty sang her lonely song to herself, and like a caged bird the onlookers came to see her and feel her call within themselves.</p>
			<p>"Everyone is lonely" Betty would say to her boys. "You've gotta sing to that lonely person inside" She would say...</p>

		<p>Recently did some test which revealed that I'm really going to enjoy my stay in hell. 7th plane of hell or some such. Bring it on!  I think the test, being all christian based, obviously gives you a "crap" score if you're not a "believer".  So much for moral guidelines, more like moral guilt.</p>
		<p>That's probably related to the genocide I perform on a daily basis here in the office.  See, I am the evil ant-slayer.  The little bastards decided to infest our offices here at the Campus. As a result, my fingers actually smell of formic acid from all the mutilated ant corpses I leave in my trail.</p>
		<p>It got me thinking though...</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><em>We're suffering heavy losses on the table-top front madam.  Casualties exceed 1% of our total combined forces.  Reports are flying in from our fly-on-the-wall scouts, reports of massive carnage.</em></p>

		<p>Recently I've had a few conversations with some kewl people about "Passion vs. profit". If you started a job on your own, or a project, do you do it for passion or for profit?</p>
		<p>I'm convinced that passion orientated work is much richer or higher quality than profit related work.  Take art as an example. While I'm no art "fundi", I'm sure that most of the best art-works ever produced were done out of passion, not profit.  Art sours when its done with profit in mind. The promise or hope of extra pennies-in-the-pocket somehow has a detrimental effect on the quality of your output.</p>
		<p>I found that recently with my work in Web Standards. Some of the best work I've produced has been out of the "hobby" fascination with the industry.  Not because I got paid to do it.</p>
		<p>How about the rest of you?</p>
		<p>One particular conversation got me to punch out this blog entry, on the topic of Medical Aid.</p>
		<p>Does anyone else feel "robbed" by insurance and medical aid companies? I'm talking to those that are healthy and haven't had an accident recently. I can't help but think that if I put all that cash I'm spending on inusrance and medical aid into a savings account, not only would I see the benefits of saving my own money, but potentially save enough money to help me when / if I'm involved in an accident.</p>
		<p>It got me thinking, what service does an insurance company really offer then?  I pay them each month for the potential risk I might one day face. For that, they take my money and spend it on those people who have accidents here and now. Why should I pay excess if I'm involved in an accident? Why do I get stoic-toned letters in the mail telling me my monthly charges are going up?</p>
		<p>It's all about the mullah.  How sad is that?  Where are the paladin's of world industry? The ones who help because they can, not because they want your gratitude.  The nameless heroes.</p>
		<p>Surely, if you put service (or passion) for your work first, profit will come later? Or will the profit-seeking-individuals you serve take you for a ride instead? Material attachment is a curse.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>On saturday night, I met a girl I was destined to meet at some point. It was arranged, so to say.</p>
		<p>I didn't get many opportunities (or rather, I didn't MAKE many opportunities) to chat to her, but when I did, I enjoyed her company, her friendly outlook on life.</p>
		<p>The night danced on and she was flirting with everyone, including me.  I liked her.  Butterflies et al.</p>
		<p>I struck up a conversation with our mutual friend, expressing my interest in this girl to which I got the following response: <cite>Shaun, she's not the long-term-relationship-kinda-girl, she's more of a party girl, so if you want her, she's more than available.</cite>.  My jaw dropped.</p>
		<p>A huge steel door dropped from the ceiling of the narrow vaulted passageway between us.  My interest sagged like a walk-the-plank type plank with a fat pirate on the end.</p>
		<p>So it got me thinking today, why?  Why the sudden loss of interest after hearing she was the one-night-stand-type?  And as a close friend pointed out: Why write her off based on someone else's statement?</p>
		<p>It made me think of past relationships, it made me think of trust.  Could I trust a girl who has such a reputation?  It made me think of love vs. lust. Do I want to be seen as another bomb icon on the hood of her tight air-frame? Do I want to come across as a guy who's just out to shag?  No! I want the whole deal, Serious Sam I am.</p>
		<p>FFS, why does life, love and maybe even lust have to be so complicated for me.  Anyway, clear points arose: Don't be so quick to judge, Listen to uncle Jay when he says: Don't believe everything you hear or read if it doesn't agree with your own common sense, and of course: Lighten the fuck up and find out for myself.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>The binary thinker, on and off, black and white.  No inbetween.  Hardline: like being shot for raising a gun.</p>
		<p>Had a great waffle, coffee and chat with "the wisest man I know" again.  So sporadic are our meetings, its like we've got the world to talk about, all pent up.</p>
		<p>We talked about past experiences, mistakes, judgements and just plain-old-human-nature.  I think I mentioned it a while back that I operate in a very black and white way, its either for or against stance.  Seems thats gotten me into trouble, burnt a few bridges too.</p>
		<p>How does one shift a mindset, or a predisposed way of thinking into a new state?  How can one unlearn something as intimate as your own thought processes? I meam to, but its gonna take time.  And patience.</p>
		<p>I was thinking the other day about the perception of time. A fly always manages to escape your slap, no matter how fast you move your hard, no matter how hellbent you are into seeing fly-splatter on the inside of your palm.  They seem to have lightning quick reactions.  Now, is it because their nervous systems are engineered for quick response (like a reports driven datasbase is architected to give speedy results), what if the Fly sees life a lot slower?</p>
		<p>How many of you think your weeks are flying by faster than they used to?  Is that because the neural pathways are getting pot-hole ridden?  Our perception of time is worsening?  Or its just another monday to sunday?  I'm sure routine fits in there somewhere.</p>
		<p>What if martial arts training (or any other quick reaction sport / game) is also training in slowing down ones perception of time? Is bullet-time even perceivable within ones existence?  I'd like to think so.</p>
		<p>Had a great round of mashie golf with my colleagues today.  I love that buzz you get from hitting a ball with the perfect strike, it goes exactly where you intended.  That's what keeps you coming back to the golf course. Sometimes I see that in life.  Little idiosyncracies (sp?) that let you know you're human.  Laughter, a smile from a stranger, being complimented, feeling appreciated, falling in love. I live for that.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>You look more delectable tonight than ever before.  Hair neatly tied back with one strand of your rich brown hair danlged over the left side of your face, angling down to your sultry mouth.  Eyes half closed, cute little nose (Maxi Jazz says it best).  Fire behind your eyes, burning for me. Your healthy skin from your exposed shoulder seems to glow, all the way up to the base of your ear, your neck surely defines the best lines ever conceived.  You're exuding confidence tonight, professional, the queen amongst the drones, a wave along a beach teasing the sand in your wake. You move through the people with a flare, I can read your inner passion. I smile, knowing that you can read mine too. You are mine and I am yours. I want to be selfish, I want you all to myself, but such beauty caged is criminal.  You are that drifting-on-the-air bee-eater, perched on my hand.  I want to take pictures, but there is no need. You'll always be in my mind, so vividly fetching.</p>

			Wind running through your hair, tickling your essence like a playful child with a smile, a smile that makes you wish you were that child, an inferno, burning inside, a baseless passion for life, interest, seeing fun in learning the ropes of life, not knowing all the pain, the evil. Only good.  Uncorrupted. Innocence is beautiful.

Suceed because you breed it, offspring flourish in your sun-shadow. You're a point of reference, Your name is Chloro Phil. You're a catalyst. Water to a seed, medium for its roots, the sun that gives life. Encouraging, always smiling, the provider. I am just a plant, I rely on you and your friends. I am your slave, Je suis a toi. Reliant, yet a provider in my own right. You would be my parent and I would have my own children. A cycle of life. Even when I die there is growth. A legacy, maybe even a legend.  Hopefully not a myth. Record me, I'm glowing.

		<p>Last weekend, a few mates and I went to the old high school to smack the cricket ball around a bit.  I ended up with a still-sore-and-bruised big toe after receiving a full pitched ball on the foot.</p>
		<p>While my toe is still-sore-and-bruised, there was something else about that saturday morning that got me thinking about South Africa as a whole.</p>
		<p>The primary cricket pitch was occupied by the First Team, and its saturday competitor. The away team was fielding first.</p>
		<p>We glanced with interest from the nets everytime the sound of willow resounded through the grounds.  Our home team was showing who was boos. Pride sweltered like the hot highveld air.</p>
		<p>(Life at and after school wasn't always about pride. This was the same high school that was marred with editorials and main-stream news articles about its racial intolerance.  I recall going to school on days where you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. Heck, I jumped on the bandwagon too.)</p>
		<p>We carried on playing in the nets, feeling like old men trying to bowl a ball like we used to.  In the nets alongside us, the first team captain or coach was pitching a few balls to the next batsmen, a black student.</p>
		<p>It wasn't long before a wicket fell and the next-in-line batsman waddled up to the pitch.  At the crease were two black students now, something I never saw in my 5 years at high school.</p>
		<p>That same tension I felt at school, I could feel again, even from the sidelines of the pitch.  The away team taunted the batsmen with overly zealous and out-of-line "HOWZZAAAAAAAAATT!"'s ringing out, ball after ball from the fielders.  The batsmen were visibly uneasy at their creases.</p>
		<p>We went on with our own smacktalk in our nets, laughing at our own batsman who probably hadn't batted in about 5 years.</p>
		<p>The sound of willow continued to pour out from the pitch, much to the delight of the home team cheering on their batsmen from the clubhouse. That sense of pride came over me again for my old high school. I smiled.</p>
		<p>Anyway, the purpose of this entry was mostly about hope in SA.  Every year students and pupils get better integrated.  In a few generations or less, we'll see a remarkably different South Africa, guided by its children (who as we all know, know better.) :)</p>
		<p>While this is a simple story about a weekend's worth of cricket anecdotes laden with heavy and potentially flame-baiting messages, I'd like to re-inforce that I hope you see it the same way I see it: "Things are improving".</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

		<p>2-3 hours more than normal: the time it took for me to actually doze off last night fighting the effects of a stoned cold fever. All my joints were aching, I was cold, felt stoned as everything was taking way too long. Shivering. Yet I hadn't done anything dubious. :/</p>
		<p>This morning I dreaded going into work, something that's been developing this year like a malignant growth on my enthusiasm gland. Partly because I had a review session with one of my managers.  I was also feeling guilty about having to deal with my irresponsiblity around thursday's drinking debauchery and the subsequent friday truancy due to excessive hang-over symptoms.</p>
		<p>The review session started off really bad. (Let's just state 2005 has not been a good year so far, in terms of my work ethic.) I took it in my stride, sucked it up, I deserved to be told off. Once that was out the way, the next 30 minutes were as they always are with our Business Development Manager: Inspiring.  I left the session with a head full of responsibilites and a renewed passion for my work. 2005 looks to be improving.</p>
		<p>That said, time to get my own life in order.  No more pissing around - I've got a career to build!  As for the personal side of things, that comes second.</p>
		<h3>Upgrade time?</h3>
		<p>I've been mulling over a much needed PC upgrade.  R6000ish for a new PC, maybe a nice LCD monitor too.  This laptop is great, but its also a work laptop.  Getting a PCI-E chipset is just ridiculous in terms of cost, I can't justify spending an extra 4 grand just to get a PCI-E Gfx card.</p>
		<p>First, a decent table and office chair for the home-office-corner is in order.</p>
		<h3>All these ideas, and no scrapbooks.</h3>
		<p>I've gotta start getting things done. I've got a ton of ideas with regard to work, my hobbies and persoanl issues.  Now I just need to turn them into realities.  One such idea was having a blog, with a photo per entry, call it: "Mental Images".  Then having a list of thoughts around the photo.  A good example was something I saw the other day in the office...</p>
		<p>We have a partner company that pretty much sells nothing, it is a fledgling company with a great idea and no implementation.  They have all the flashiest marketing and awesome office decor.  Anyway, they had a whole host of coffee mugs embossed with their logos, nice looking mugs.  We happened to acquire one within our office, which we use as the dirty spoon cup for all our coffee needs.  The handle is broken on this mug.  I thought: "Hey, that's a metaphor for the company itself!  It might hold water, but its not very useful.".  Of course, this idea would have to be incorporated in my own site, running on my own box at an ISP.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">

			<p>Betty was your average Hotel Worker, mid to late 30's, a passion for cigarettes and a distinct distaste for her job. Today was going to be another notch in her totem pole of hotel work oddities.</p>
			<p>Picking up clothes in the entrance area, Betty got on with her routine as she typically did, a thousand times over. There was a damp smell on air inside the penthouse room, the aircon's probably need some regassing again.</p>
			<p>The Royal Beagle Hotel, your average hotel (with all those appealing extras like Chocolates-on-your-pillows) was situated in downtown Manhattan.  Prices were good for such a neighbourhood, so the clientele was volumnous and recyclable.</p>
			<p>"Hmm, this is the second time this week I'm picking up flower vases again, what is with these people!" Betty muttered to herself as she brushed all the pottery pieces into her hungry and awaiting tray. The flowers lay lifeless, still pretty, but with no glow.</p>
			<p>Betty made her way to the master bedroom, a place she used countless times as the basis for wealthy marriage to that someone special. The double arch doors were almost latched closed, a sliver of light separating the two in half. Betty put her weight into the door but hit her right arm and shoulder against the now stuck door.  With a hefty push, the door flung open.</p>
			<p>Nerves went cold and useless. Muscles relaxed in Betty's left hand, releasing the air freshener can and the cleaning cloth.  The can rattled off the marble floor with a sound that startled its former owner.  Betty let out the scream like her own life depended on it.</p>

		<p>At school, I did my best to avoid any sort of bullying. I felt sick to my stomach each time I was belittled.  I dreaded people talking about me behind my back, sometimes even catching people talking about me without them knowing I was within audible distance.</p>
		<p>Kids.  Evil things.  I resorted to ignoring, or playing aloof.  I was a fool.  I still am a fool.</p>
		<p>I have a big problem with not knowing my enemy, my foe must have a face and name.  So it can be personal.</p>
		<p>Anyway, I got a rude, spoofed SMS the other day.  Something very personal.  Something that attacked me.  And I didn't know who sent it.</p>
		<p>I had a hint of who it could have been, but I needed proof before laying baseless accusations and upsetting someone else. So I phoned MTN's customer services to find out if they could trace the SMS.</p>
		<p>Turns out they don't have the means to do such things.  Plan B: Survey suspicions - Jackpot! What was intended as a practical joke was now blown horribly out of proportions. I was livid.</p>
		<p>What really irked me was finding out who delivered the message. Someone I know and trust and don't expect such things from. Someone who in my mind has always been fair and humble.</p>
		<p>It puts a lot of things into perspective for me.  Nasty things too.</p>
		<h3>I know a supposed-porn star!</h3>
		<p>I can rest well, knowing that I once met a supposed real-life porn star. Someone who's family I know too.</p>
		<p>My mom and her dad got on real well, he was a bit of a selfish tool, but he was good for my mom. He was one of those supposed parents that thought distraction and money are good ways of getting your kids out of your hair.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Staind - Open your eyes</p>
			<p>
				[...]<br />
				A boy just 13 on the corner for sale<br />
				Swallows his pride for another hit<br />
				Overpopulation there's no room in jail<br />
				But most of you don't give a shit<br />
				That your daughters are porno stars<br />
				and Your sons sell death to kids<br />
				You're so lost in your little worlds<br />
				Your little worlds you'll never fix<br />
				[...]
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Anyway, this "porn star" chick now lives in the same complex as me. She's a real poppie too. No emotion. No morals. Just a shagging-for-a-living-shit-for-brains-sh<wbr />eep.  She is filth, and she's not even hot.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"What do you do Ms. Angel Jugs?" Enquired the reporter.</p>
			<p>"I am a masseur." said the make-up over-indulged bimbo.</p>
			<p>"Oh, that's lovely. What do you charge your clients?" The reported smirked.</p>
			<p>"Normal massage: fifty rond. Happy ending: one hundred and fifty rond." she replied in her hollow virgin way.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Jealousy. But Why?</h3>
		<p>I'm jealous, because you promise me things, that you now give to someone else.</p>
		<p>I'm cross, beacuse you need to hide things from me, and others.</p>
		<p>You are that filth, you don't know love, because you confuse it with lust. You spread your sickness like your legs, the men love it. I loved it once. I feel dirty.</p>
		<p>I would cleanse myself if it would help you, but you're too ignorant for that.  Go and be what you want to be, but don't preach about the right when you only do wrong and all his brothers.</p> </div><div style="text-align:right">
