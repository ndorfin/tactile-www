&lt;h3&gt;Set it off&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Shut up, just shut up!  We don't need to talk.  I'm just as comfortable here in this silence, this silence filled with the sight of your smile and your smell.  Smell is not the word, smell is harsh.  Fragrance is false and scent... now scent is close but not perfect.  Scent is primal and basic.  If you could mix scent with something like the way you breath deeply in my ear, that would be the word. Your hot breath in my ear.  It drives me fucking insane and you know it.  It's your leash over me, but a leash that is comfortable.  No pain involved, just like silk.  A silken leash that gestures and doesn't pull. You're amazing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I close my eyes and imagine the lights are out. I know you're close, but I can't feel you. I can feel you, but I can't touch you.  That's a six sense we have.  A sense for presence. Picking up energy, boundless energy that awaits to fuel internal fires.  Internal fires, how lusty of you to think. I'm talking about internal fires that fuel more than the engine room and keep the lights on in the cabin. The fires that keep the music playing and the little people aboard this vessel smiling.  I can't say boats - just a vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;But you're not here, and I'm not here either. I feel like I've been preparing my whole life for the time that I will spend with you.  I've disciplined my mind, but I know that no preparation can prepare me for when I am with you. I don't need to prepare, because the mistakes I make will be as important as the gestures and the fact that I'm just being me and you're totally into it.  Maybe that's what I want. To be accepted. My faults will be anchoring points as strong as the strengths I offer. That rock in the road is there to make the car bump, not puncture the tyre. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else think that possible negative qualities in someone, are just as sexy as their good qualities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The invite&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A short story inspired in part by truth&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The child's cries for help didn't go unnoticed. The terriers barked at the walls of our house, as if the walls themselves were at fault. Inbetween the yips and woofs I could make out the faint sound of a child in distress.  My heart raced as I climbed the stairs to the master bedroom on the first floor, a vantage point.  The shapes made more sense as I squinted through the tinted windows, 4 men were dragging a pair of goats into our neighbours yard. The goat was bleeting an alarmed and scared tone, a sinister, primal tone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What should I do?  What shouldn't I do.  Here we were in civilised suburbia and our neighbours are taking in a pair of goats for butchering.  It seemed so cruel, so basic. Then I thought to myself, who am I to label another culture's activities in such a way?  They have as much a right to live here in Pleasantville as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The witnessed story came up at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"You can take them out the bush" sneered my father-in-law. A bitter statement from someone who's expected to set the example. I recoiled inside, I wanted to right his wrongs in front of my impressionable younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mom dodged the statement as always and instead offered her own. "They've invited us around for a Thanksgiving evening on Saturday". She looked over at me and asked: "Would you like to go with me, Shaun?"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I felt cornered. I'd like to think I have an open mind, but the thought of spending an evening with complete strangers frightened me, even if I stuck my head over the wall to say Hi every now and then. Not to disappoint a lady asking for a dance, I said yes.  A date with my mom. Saturday. Dress Casual.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Saturday was upon us. I put on my favourite jeans and a comfortable shirt and headed upstairs.  A quick survey revealed the goats were still leashed to the tree in the neighbours backyard. Hopeless goats. Mom emerged freshly powdered, she was ready to mingle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We stepped outside. There were cars parked wherever pavement allowed, fancy Mercs, plenty of BMWs and even a car guard walked amongst them.  I rang the bell, acting as mom's bodyguard. Jazz oozed out from behind the front-door, oozing that soon overflowed when the door swung open against the tide. A lady in her late 30s greeted us in English with a quizzical look on her face. I responded in Xhosa, she smiled. I felt the mask being lifted off my face.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once inside, smells of earthy cooking and cigarette smoke came to. I felt like the clothes on my back were being scrutinised, that my walk was being studied. I felt naked. Mom was equally tense but smiling like a trooper. Our hostess introduced us around, names I could scarcily reproduce. I was never good with names.  A drink in hand each, we started to relax. Mom was chatting to our neighbour while I shot-gunned the breeze with her equally aged son.  He was a perpetual student. I was a work-a-holic. He was religious. I had given up hope. He liked Castle Lager.  I had just finished my third Amstel. Or was it my third?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The party evolved and I bore witness to Darwin's theories being shot to pieces. Booze can be a terrible thing. An elderly, twisted man came up to me.  He wore critique on his face, maybe even a snarl. To cut the ice I asked if he'd teach me some Xhosa words. He whispered in my ear.  Everyone else had stopped their conversations and were watching the exchange, trying to eavesdrop on his whisper in my ear. In a slurring English and Xhosa he whispered in my ear "Tell them the following... " "Say to them..." and what he said I can't repeat. Seeing I was on stage, I turned to my audience and said in fluent Xhosa: "He said I must say to tell you all that he's got balls the size of an elephant's!"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The crowd burst out laughing and I too laughed. Mom stood there trying to make sense of it all, laughing along with everyone else. My antagonist was not even smiling. One of the uncles came forward and put his burly arms around the two of us and made us the best of friends. We shook hands and shared more drinks to the sounds of "No hard feelings" in Xhosa. I felt at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That night, the goats too found peace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A blank &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a first, I'm actually typing into the LJ Entry field, as its coming to me.  Before, I used to save an HTML draft on my PC then copy-paste it to this entry field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to do some writing earlier this month, but I wasn't happy with it, so I left it out.  I've been thinking a lot about dreams, specifically mine and how to deal with them.  I have a mountain in the way of my idyll, like a lost world. For some reason I sit here instead and try pass time as fast and memoryless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the easiest route normally the worst for you? Why does the fatty, oily food taste the best? Why does crime never pay?  Surely evolution is about taking the easy route, or the most obvious. e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to evolve your walking fore-arms to grasp a tool. Your survival depends on it. First, you start freeing up your fore-limbs by standing on your rear-limbs first. Your brain develops to cope with the new balancing act. Your rear-limbs change shape to accommodate the new load. Your fore-limbs start to take less load than before, so they too change by becoming lighter. Your eyes move to the front of your head so you can judge distance. You develop joints so intricate the muscles have to be stowed somewhere else. Your brain reports gridlock on the now bustling neural highways.  You frustrate yourself as a baby would, struggling to communicate with its parents, as its parents do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it would have been better to use mental telekenisis to grasp a tool instead?  How much easier would it have been to just grow a bigger brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's the thing.  Maybe the easiest choice is not the rounding choice, that is, the choice that builds and develops you.  Why have we as a species resorted to the easiest choice? Why do we daily take the shortest and quickest route to the destination?  Are we in for trouble by being the instant-gratification ceaselessly-demanding species?  Are we surviving now or is the rest of the world trying to survive in our wake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe humans have bridged the need to survive.  We're our own masters now.  We may die, but as a species we're the ones climbing on the PA aimed at the stars shouting how successful we are. Is that arrogant to say and think we will overcome all? When does mother nature throw us the curve-ball?  When are we to be faced with that Extinction Level Event? Maybe it's not going to be a flaming meteor or the sun burning up.  Maybe it's us.  Aren't we our own ELE? In our blind fumbling arrogance are we going to trip over the coffee table and smash open our heads like you would with grapes in a grape press?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm driving up to Joburg tomorrow.  I'm dreading it.  I've been so happy in my sedated nirvana here. Back in Joburg I have to face new horizons as well as send letters to the people staying behind. I have to close chapters of my life whilst signing up for the new publishing deal that I've been mulling over for the last 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to escape is to read.  It's the same as playing on the PC for me. Mom says I should rather read so I can formulate an opinion on a book, so that you've got something to talk about. It makes you... interesting.  It's the same as reading the paper, even if the hogwash you're reading is totally negative, possibly propoganda propvol and well... mediocre. At least you can formulate an opinion on the current affairs.  Isn't having no opinion on current affairs just as good as having an opinion (an opinion that could be influenced by afore-mentioned subtle propoganda).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that's what it's all about. If you want to mingle with the Average Joe, you've got to at least think like him, talk like him, eat the same (fatty/oily) food as him.  You've gotta say: "Man, have you heard Paris Hilton's latest single? It Rocks!".  [While I'm reading this, I can't help but think that I want to become a total hermit. I want to find my log-cabin in the woods (maybe somewhere Canada-ish) and learn how to fend off the Canada-ish grizzlies and fish for Canada-ish food. Then when the human race wipes itself out, I'll emerge from the woods and weep. - Now, why is that?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence is total nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Adventures in fiction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a book recommendation. (Fancy that! I have an opinion on something!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went book shopping (cos the games on my PC were getting old, and it is Mom's birthday soon).  The place: Exclusive Books, Cape Gate.  I found a good book for mom, then my escapist-addiction clawed at my happy nerve like a dog at your ankles wanting a scratch. So, I asked the clerk if he could recommend a book similar to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel.&lt;br /&gt;
"Did you know that book was a cheap rework of some old eastern story!"  He proudly exclaimed, proving to me he had an opinion on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;"Uh, no, I didn't. Is that so!" I retorted, trying to sound interested whilst I was recoiling inside - All I wanted was a fucking book recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;
"I haven't actually read it though.  A friend told me."&lt;br /&gt;
"..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems these days you don't even need to read something to formulate an opinion on it.  You can take your friend's opinion and use it as your own.  Maybe spice it up with a bit of spittle and words such as cheap.  All the cynicism aside, he did perform. In my grubby paws I've got the latest winner of the Whitbread Literary Awards.  It's called: "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time" by Mark Haddon. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curious-Incident-Night-Time-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/1400032717/sr=8-4/qid=1159744038/ref=pd_bbs_4/102-8013478-0632932?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;Linky&lt;/a&gt;. It's different. It's smart. Maybe it's different because it's smart. I dunno. I'm a third of the way through it, and enjoying it.  Maybe you would too? [/Unpimp.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny that, I did an Amazon search for "Life of Pi", and my book recommendation, like the book-clerk's recommendation, is sitting fourth in the search results.  Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's late and I've got a lot of driving to do tomorrow.  If you don't mind, I'd like to escape to my bed.  Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Still Scared&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Domestic situation aside, there were some spectacular adventures awaiting outside.  Mornings in the warming sun spent eating Strawberry Pops or just-plain-All-Bran.  Playing with the dogs or just laughing as they chased the pedestrians in the street. I was at peace with the sun in my lap.  Which made me realise... I had been spending far too much time indoors.  Always in front of that frikkin PC, trying to waste as much time as possible, and for what! Outside I felt alive and inspired.  The real adventure was a trip in the car though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lee-Anne's mom spent a week with us. She can only be described as good natured and content. When the weekend approached, we made off for the village of Nieu-Bethesda, halfway between Graaff-Reniet and Middelburg.  To get there, we had to take 15km of dirt roads along some winding and bumpy roads through the Karoo.  Ask yourself first, what is the Karoo?  Is it a barren and boring semi-arid ecotype? Is it the place of sheep farmers and flat-out hardship? In a way it can be, but that was not my experience. My preconceived notions of the Karoo meant I was delighted to see what it was really about.  There was thornveld, grassland, karoo bossies, mountains and the sunsets. So picture it.  We drove off the grassland onto a winding road up through the thornveld to a new plateau. The Compassberg mountain in full view on the horizon, covered in snow.  Blue blue skies dotted with little white-candy-floss mushrooms. A pothole here and there and Malachite Sunbirds dancing from flowering Aloe to Aloe, like pretty whores visiting all the men in town. The road descended from the plateau and within a few corners later we were looking down on a huge canyon.  Bradley stopped the car. Out came the camera and binocs. It was only until the camera was away that I really took in the view. A pair of Black Eagles drifted in the currents above while the water tripped over the rocks below. A lone basalt spire seemed defiant in the path of the water, and a tree grew from the top of the spire.  How stubborn nature can be. Back in the car, Nieu Bethesda came into view.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nieu-Bethesda is nestled in the same giant canyon, a canyon forged by a tributary of the Sundays River. The day god rested. The village didn't even have tarred roads.  Dogs lay in the street lapping up the sun and keeping eyes on the tourists.  We made our way to one of the "Country Kitchens" and took in stories from the owner, who I'm sure was trying hard to look like Ernest Hemingway.  Home-made Ginger Beer and Lamb Curry hit the apetite spot. After being harrassed by the Pied Starlings we made our way to the Fossil exhibit they had in town.  And I'm talking about real fossils, not the old folk in town. The little museum was a gem and the walk along the river bed proved to be a good hands-on paleontological experience. The clouds above looked like massive waves now.  Another cold-front was due.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The highlight of the Nieu-Bethesda trip was a ramble through the Owl House. It's an art project done by a single woman in the early 1900's.  Surreal and weird. Her house is full of mirrors and crushed glass on the walls. And lots of owls, staring at you with their glassy eyes. Outside, massive concrete and wire abhorations stand, sculptures inspired by arab writings, the bible and other spiritual works. Camels, Cranes, Women in servitude, Pilgrims.  Wire messages and spray-paint - just plain odd! Bjork comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sun was setting, so we scoffed down some rusks and took off back to Middelburg up a different road. When the sun finally set, we were on the top of the ridge, panoramic views on either side.  On the one side, a setting sun and shadows. On the other side, a pink landscape with the shadows of the ridge cutting through it.  I waved to where my shadow should be but it was lost in the distance.  I was either too far from the sun or too far from my shadow, caught in the middle between leaving a legacy and being inspiration.  Sunsets in the Karoo are magical things. The Karoo can't give you a massive expanse of water to reflect the sun's dying rays, but it can give you skies that turn apricot in the speckles of high-altitude clouds and shadows that stretch for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How easy it could be to find yourself lost in such a virgin landscape. Many of the days out there in the sun were similar, but I was in for a surprise.  Bradley's colleague John was down from Joburg to work on some &lt;acronym title="Geographical Information System"&gt;GIS&lt;/acronym&gt; data of Cranes. The first day, we went out onto the farms to test the data, data that flagged Crane roost sites that were near powerlines. Powerlines are without a doubt the highest threat to Blue Cranes.  Since Cranes only roost at night on shallow patches of water, it's quite easy to identify where the powerlines and water-sources cross, if the data is there. It was an overcast day.  Driving along the N9 towards Graaff Reniet again approaching the Lootsberg Pass. The clouds dropped lower and lower until our bakkie was driving through them.  Spotting Cranes today would be hard but when we reached the other side of the pass, visibility improved.  It wasn't long before we saw snow drifting down. When we stopped in at one of the farmsteads and Bradley played diplomat, I was taken aback by the sight of a Peach Tree in full blossom, with the snow all around us. It's not everyday you're walking around in the snow and the trees are in defiant blossom. The snow worsened, but even in the snow we saw Cranes going about their foraging business, unperturbed by the stationary bakkie and its three oogling occupants. We decided to hightail it to the Wapadsberg Pass before the snow trapped us on the wrong side of the mountains. We ascended the pass and discovered a new land, covered in white. A little further on the road to Cradock and not a spec of snow to be seen.  Man, Cradock must be a boring town!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Middelburg, when we finally got back, was covered in at least an inch of snow. I loved the way it crunched under my boots and left well-defined footprints. I decided against taking the Subaru onto the high-school rugby pitch and doing doughnuts through the snow. A decision I regret now. :D  Still, my Scooby proved a great source of entertainment for the locals. When driving through town, I let the engine reach and grab, much to the delight of the liquor-store faithful. The car was dirty from the snow, so I decided it was time to take it to the only car-wash in town.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There, a man named Jannie in his late 40s ran shop with 2 others locals. Jannie took a personal pride in his washing work. I sat and failed miserably at reading the next sadistic short story by Roald Dahl as I watched them clean the Wagoon from top to bottom, inside and out. Jannie and Martin (one of his mates) were asking questions about the car, questions I was happy to answer.  I in turn asked them about their lives in Middelburg. Jannie was a retired cop with no regrets for leaving the force, after he wrecked his back in service. Martin on the other hand, was an english speaking Natal boy realist with a distaste of being called "Oom".  We laughed at some white-trash walking into the shop next door with an old South African flag on his shirt. We laughed at how you can now advertise your ignorance by wearing such a T-Shirt. The car was spotless when Jannie handed me the keys and I paid up. Then I did something unexpected. I gave the keys back to Jannie and said he should take it for a spin. (With me in the passenger seat of course!) He had this huge smile on his face as he closed his fingers around the keys. He pulled off quite gingerly onto the main road and snapped it into 2nd. Then he eased in the revs till the car was singing at 6000 RPM and snapped it into 3rd gear.  (Man, I love second gear in my scoob!)  An unceremonious u-turn later we headed back to the Car Wash. Jannie got out and paraded over to Martin and said: "Jissie Martin, maar daai ding fokken trek!".  I smiled inside and said my goodbyes and thanks. :)  Turns out, Middelburg doesn't get a lot of fancy cars in town.  The N9 doesn't even cut through town, so seeing a Subaru in town is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rest of my time in Middelburg was easy-going, but it was time to leave.  Field work dwindled as Bradley succumbed to office and administration work. As fate would have it, Bradley had a week-long conference to attend to in the Free State and I felt like my time was up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The last weekend was mindblowing. Saturday was spent in the Valley of Desolation, a spot in Camdeboo National Park on the outskirts of Graaff Reniet.  Lee-Anne and I walked around town taking in the sights as Bradley went to the local Radio Studio to record his weekly Conservation talk. On the way to the Valley we dropped off the DJ in the township on the edge of town.  Camdeboo is a minor success story in terms of national parks.  Local land has been donated and somehow the park manages to survive right on the edge of Graaff Reniet.  The park itself is a typcial Karoo park, but the highlight is the Valley of Desolation.  In the middle of the park, overshadowing Graaff-Reniet is a massive rocky-outcropping, mountain even. We drove past the dam which was almost at capacity and entered the park. The mainroad took us past herds of Zebra, Springbok, Rooi Hartebees then started to ascend.  Twisting up towards the top, new views at every turn. The trees parted at points on the journey, showing us the dam from elevation and bits of the town below. Then we came to a peer of sorts in the mountain-top. We parked the car and took the brief walk to the top of the lookout point.  When I got to the top ahead of the others I jumped on a rock and stared out in total amazement.  The view I was presented with was breath-taking. The sun was descending behind me. A long blade-like cloud stretched from the west all the way to the east as if the sun had severed the sky with one slashing strike. I faced the town and twisted over my left shoulder to see the rest of the mountain range and the slowly setting sun.  To my left, in the valley below, 2 black eagles were soaring in what was left of the afternoon thermals. Looking further right, the shadow of the mountain range was covering Graaff Reniet. I could make out schools, churches and the various income-based houses. The rich homes with massive trees and swimming pools. The poorer folk had to live out of town in RDP townships.  And there was this river surrounding the town, almost as if the town was a frying egg in a hot pan and the river was playing with the edges, as a bored breakfast cook would. Various mountain ridges faded into the distance behind town. Each successive range being more blue than the one in front of it until you couldn't make out the sky from the mountains anymore.  Horizons melting together with the sky. Looking to my right now and a lone peak juts out of the totally flat surroundings. Massive waves of rock stretch away from us to the right. Waves going out.  If time was inconsequential, I'd be walking on watery rock watching the waves as they head to the beach. Now I've got my head over my right shoulder and I'm following that long cloud to the hilt. The sun is drooping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We hurried back to the car and drove half-way round the rest of the mountain to see if we could catch the point where the sun turns red.  The birds were singing their dusk sonnets and the sky was turning that Karoo Pink again. We missed the sun setting, but the view below us made up for it. A towering rocky outcrop that was home to Starlings, Kestrels and various Dove species. The echoes of their calls made it seem even more epic than it was. We had 20 minutes to leave the park. Just as well we had to leave, I would have been lost in this world, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Back to Cape Town&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I took the same route back to Slaapstad but this time it was different. No rain! The drive past Graaff Reniet towards Oudtshoorn on the N9 was rather boring, the landscape barren. At some points all you could see to the horizon was karoo bossies and dusty earth. So flat! Then Beervlei Dam approached. It was in stark contrast to when I drove past it the first time, there was water, and lots of it! I bet the farmers in the area cried tears of joy at the rain and subsequently helped fill the dam.  I resolved to stop this time and was glad I did.  I took a short walk up from the car-rest area below the dam, up to the dam wall.  From there I took out the binocs and scanned the ridges. A massive Hammerkop nest amongst the rocks and a black eagle hid behind the ridge. I felt like I was being followed. The wind was cool. Motorists sped past as I picked some daisies for Mom on the way back to the car.  "Hrmmph, Silly motorists! They don't know what they're missing."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Back in the car, it wasn't long before I reached the R341. I crossed swords with massive mountain ridges and cut my way through the passes. Fields of green, fruit trees, lucern and cattle farms.  That distinctive and somehow-good-smell of cow manure. Some of the black mountains still wore their silky white underpants on their heads. Green rolling fields in front of them.  150km/h. Dang... a town approaches. 120. 80. 60. Argh, 3rd gear.  It's Barrydale and boy was I happy the speed limit was 60. The town was beautiful!  It was then that I realised why motorists sped on their ways - it's the destination.  I was still a few hours out from Cape Town and the sun was setting once again.  I'd be driving into the sun. I neglected to stop or drive around Barrydale, but I swore that I'd come back some day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rest of the return trip was just as beautiful, but as the sun set, traffic volume picked up as I neared Worcester. With the increase of volume and night-time came the SA driver's bad manners. Overtaking at night on an strange stretch of road proved taxing. People drive like idiots. Me included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once I was on the N1 the going was much easier. I was back in Cape Town, in good time too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Scared to be someone else&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've been putting away the thought of some blogging for a while now and I don't know why.  Maybe it's a routine thing, maybe it's the fact that I'm sitting at a PC again.  Whatever it is, it doesn't feel as good as writing a letter, something that's personal.  Blogging is like being a self-important mediocre attention-grabbing media-whore. Whatever that is.  GAH!  I'm so mediocre! :P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2 months away from the norm though.  2 months away from routine and stress and the same old-thinking.  2 months has given me time to re-evaluate what's important, what's missing and maybe even what's wrong and needs to be righted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Destination: Cape Town and Relaxation&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was deliberating over the drive down to Cape Town, until I finally packed enough equipment that would make Ashanti embarrased and bundled it all into the Wagoon.  The trip down was much easier than I first thought, being off-peak and in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I got into Kimberley at midnight, and decided to check out the local pub. What strange enthusiasm I had for mingling with complete strangers quickly subsided when I saw I was the only snow-white amongst the seven-hundred dwarves. I played the disillusioned tourist as I turned for the door.  A quick tour of the Casino and I felt my eyelids droop, 1AM was looming and watching old people robotically fill machines with coins was taxing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not-so-early the next morning I got up for some run-down scrambled eggs and toast. Then I fired up the Scoob and nailed the remaining 8+ hours of driving.  It always feels like I'm driving home when I head into Cape Town.  Mom, Patrick and Mike have a house they can call a home too, it's got awesome views of the mountains surrounding Franshoek and Stellenbosch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A week in Cape Town turned into two, after a timing mix-up with my hosts in Middelburg, but I wasn't complaining. :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I spent a few days agonising over the intended trip and route choice.  I could slip along the coast (after avoiding getting stoned by the locals on the N2) and take a sharp left at George.  Or, I could motor up the N1 till Colesburg and then take the semi-civilised N9 down to Middelburg.  So I took the prize behind door number 3, the regional roads.  Mike suggested I head to Worcester then take the road-less-travelled to Montagu, Barrydale, Oudtshoorn etc.  A suggestion which proved priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I left Cape Town at midday, it was raining. (The rain didn't let up until I got to Graaff-Reniet.) Overcast and drizzling, perfect conditions for my silver steed. Colours saturated by the grey light.  A phonecall which turned out to be a job offer, another good omen. Then I slipped out of the next valley and was humbled by view.  I was out in the middle of nowhere, a nowhere more beautiful than I had first imagined. A nowhere where I was just myself and no-one else. I wept and drove through the tears. Men &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do two things at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Swartberge kept me in awe, on a twisting towards Montagu like the snake that had been here before.  Montagu is very pretty, I'm sorry I didn't stop over and take it in.  Winelands, orchards in the first sprout of the season and more rain.  Dips and rises, corners and fast straights.  Sometimes the clouds would be just high enough, high enough to see the towering peaks overshadowing us puny humans as we muddled on on our conquest of the valley. A wet Oudtshoorn came and went and soon the sun was setting. On one particular bend, the sun was setting over a vast empty dam. It looked lunar-ish and lifeless peeking into the empty bowels of the Beervlei dam. I kicked myself for not stopping and taking a photo or three, but my destination was calling. Soon it was pitch black outside and still pock-marks of rain splattered on the windshield.  Here I was, in the heart of the dry Karoo, and it was raining.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Graaff-Reniet passed by after I emptied my own bowels at the first fuel-stop I could find. "100km to Middelburg." I say to myself while trying to sing along to Live. "70 now. Lootsberg Pass, corners, yummy. Wrrrrrrp, no tsssh. 30. 20. 15. Argh. 10. Lights! I've made it! Wow, that's a lot of lights, this place must be civilised!"  Your first greeting by Middelburg is a massive RDP development, cheap housing for the new masses in town. I had visions of spending my nights in a hut, visions which both scared and excited me. The town centre was typically small with all the basic ammenities, but it was lacking one thing I wasn't keen on finding: Stress. I quickly found my hosts street and made my way down it's wide berth. Some poor people, some rich. Rich or not, it would be my home for a while. In the end, I found number 28 and it turned out just right. Fear departed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There's something to be said about meeting someone you don't know for the first time, especially when you're to spend time together. When I figure it out, I'll tell you.  Anyway, I met Bradley, his wife Lee-Anne and a local friend: Darlene.  Happy crowd. Awkwardness subsided after I managed to clean out the car, it must have looked like I was moving in!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That night I fell asleep on the small bed, the exhausting trip and pent-up expectation had taken it's toll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Stuck in the Middelburg of nowhere&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Middelburg, for the geography enthusiasts, is a lonely Great-Karoo town stuck halfway between Colesburg and Graaff-Reniet in the Eastern Cape, with Cradock (The hometown of Cow_Art) a stone's throw away too.  Contrary to expectations, the town is nestled in a hilly area of the Karoo in what is prime stock-farming land.  The town is also in the heart of Blue Crane country, one of the reasons I was here. (I'll let you figure out the other reasons.) The town features as many liquor stores as churches (and there quite a few liquor stores) plus all your basics including a library, Spar and various other retail outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The average day for the first week was riding shotgun whilst Bradley and I investigated farmer sightings of the elegant birds. We saw 38 Cranes in the first 3 days. We'd also spend time pouring over maps of the area matching GPS coordinates of sightings to farm names and stand numbers. Which turned out to be too easy, I love map-work! Bradley, in my opinion, is more a diplomat for conservation than a ranger.  His work is wide-ranged and far-reaching.  This was most evident when we took a day-trip out past Noupoort to visit one of the farm schools.  Here, Bradley gave a brief presentation on Crane Conservation to the wide-eyed pupils, followed by a puppet show, something some of the poor kids had never seen before.  What is a child without imagination?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After-hours, I was on permanent dishes and tea-making duty, I felt I had to pull my weight where I could.  Darlene visited often, which was good, I think things would have been a bit too weird if it was just the three of us, plus Darlene was bubbly and fun :)  I also took up reading with a renewed vigour. I finished a novel and a number of short stories by Roald Dahl and Peter F. Hamilton.  I was reintroduced to local TV, mesmerised by the Heartlines series and watching 50/50 stirred many memories.  On some of the off days, I'd get on my bike and explore Middelburg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mountain Biking is a great way to get around.  I saw plenty of Karoo Robins west of town, and even interrupted a Jackal Buzzard from it's fresh pigeon kill.  The second time I went out on the bike, I cycled through the local township, gettting some amazed stares and shouts of excitement from the kids wandering in the streets.  It must have been really weird to see this white-legged-freak go through the ghetto on a race-worthy mountain bike.  I smiled and waved where I could, trying to shrug off my predisposed fears.  I dreamt of sharing a beer or three with some of the locals too. My biggest concern was using the right greeting. isiZulu and Sesotho wouldn't cut it, I didn't know any Xhosa and saying something in Afrikaans would probably get me stoned, so I resorted to "Hello".  My second trip through the same township, I stopped off at the soccer pitch to watch a local game for a bit.  The score was 0-0, which became 1-0 when the team facing me conceded a goal.  Probably distracted. :D  My bike had endless punctures when I took the rough routes over Dubbeltjie country, so I stuck to the car-trails where I could.  I felt alive!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At times I felt like I was in the way, especially from Lee-Anne's perspective.  I got the idea that she didn't really have any influence in the decision to take on a volunteer for conservation work, and was therefore put out by the whole thing. Husband and Wife weren't exactly in love anyway.  It just got uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Enough for now.  Expect more later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why do you build me up butterfuckup?&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Heart broken again, but it's to be expected.  Never look for love over the internet, you're bound to bump into some of the most heartless in the world.  JPEGs and p tags can be deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Right now I'm thinking of Jayesh, and him saying something like: "Told you so".  That really grates my cheese.  Telling me I'm wrong, and telling me again. It's like putting salt in a wound.  It's sadistic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Foundations aside, it's now time for Franz Ferdinand. Twisted guitars, totally out of key.  It's great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I say... take me out!"  Is he talking about getting shot?  Or is he talking about a potential date?  Maybe both?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I know I won't be leaving here, with you" If your attacker shoots you, you go to heaven or hell or that void.  Or is he setting himself up with low expectations and go for the loose girl getting drunk with your friends?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Free - All right now, innocent love. Sassy, confidence in there too.  5FM, all those guys and one girl on parade, just like any girl who knows she's got what it takes. She's out there at the window, strutting her stuff, all the guys think she's doing it just for him, but it's not for them, it's for her own delight. Selfish bitch!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Full circle now. 5FM adverts. 5fmdating.co.za. Why don't they just call it: www.getfuckedhere.co.za.  So many helpless souls, so many people looking for their own definition of love, whether it includes a condom or not.  Sickness.  Why the fuck am I looking for love in such a place?  I could be like every other jock out there, drinking it up, pressing iron inbetween. Go to clubs, cos that's what "normal" people do.  Pick up loose and drunk girls, cos that's what "normal" people do.  Shag cos you need to.  Roll on AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"What do I do, with all these feelings tearing me up inside." Freshly ground. Such a beautiful song. Placid yet sombre. Tempo relaxed and voice subdued but lucid.  Violin crescendo, something is building up, flute to dance. And that voice emerges, glorifying, not a word is said but so much is heard. It's a precious moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"What would you do if I kissed you" Cheeky confidence. A smile there too, maybe even naughty.  This song, is how I'd like to feel about someone, and them to feel about me. If feelings could be recorded, it would be through a song. Words don't count, where are the rising background instruments, the uplifting tinkering of a voice in words?  Imagination is only as powerful as a solitary thought. Music is sharing that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bradley stomped on the brakes inches in front of the porch of the lone farmstead.  It was a traditional design for a farmhouse, a huge open porch covering the perimeter of the house.  Wiltering flowers in pots suspended from the tops of the pilars supporting the hot-tin roof.  I opened my door to the bakkie, hot karoo dust caught in the inertia swarmed into the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A ridgeback with wonderful temprement greeted us at the bottom of the steps to the front door. She barked, not out of alarm, but just to say: "Hey Baas, we got visitors!"  2 arbitrary pats to the head from Bradley, sufficient enough? I thought not, so I gave her a scratch under her collar.  Doesn't it feel great when you scratch the itchy spot for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Blitz, down!" came a voice from within the farmhouse.  It was neither commandingly stern nor care free. It was somewhere inbetween.  It was a woman's voice, which sort of caught me off guard.  Most of the farmers in these parts are crusty old ex-colonialists, all male, save for this farm it seems.  Blitz, with tail wagging, ascended the stairs to introduce us visitors to the baas. "Her name is Debbie" Bradley whispered to me as we neared the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Well well, look what happens when you call the eco-police!" Debbie swung the door open and greeted us with a smile. "Bradley!  It's been too long!  Come on in..." motioning to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Debbie, this is Shaun, Shaun, this is the baas, Debbie."  Debbie instantly grinned when Bradley called her the baas. Old friends perhaps? She shook my hand with a frim grasp as we interchanged formalities. I guess it takes a tough girl to run a wheat farm.  "Come on through boys, I just made some iced-tea."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Nothing to write about while I wait to feel sleepy&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Closing eyes, drifting away.  Bring on the subconcious, check my visa and stamp my passport, I'm on the way to Peacefulla'blivion. Subconcious leads the way, a good guide.  In a strange land where the locals speak in no known language, yet are totally understandable. They're telling me things of importance, and things of absolutely no consequence. Some are warnings, warnings I maybe refused to heed the first time. Warnings being re-told.  Subconcious leads on, grabbing me by my hand and pulling me off my legs. I'm floating, I can see far below, there are people down there who can't see me. They're so busy with their lives, their treadmills of lives. I want to wake them up so they can dream. I want to shake them from their production lines and their predefined routes.  I want to put a roadblock up on their usual highway so that they can travel down the lanes where the leafy trees grow, where the houses are open and children play in the front gardens. Where there are no stop streets or traffic lights, just you, your journey and time to look around and soak up all the saturated colours.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Is it up to me though? Is it right to break someone away from what they're familiar to?  Is it their choice to remain oblivious?  Would they appreciate birdsong in a world filled with carhorn?  I'd like to think so. Maybe they're all sleepers like me, but just don't know how to dream. Zzzz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...or is there?  My routine shifts into a different gear tomorrow. No more late nights, no more oversleeping. It's going to be... difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My trip to the Karoo has been delayed by a fortnight.  Poor Timing, Babysitting and their unlikely accomplice: Flu conspired to keep me in Cape Town.  I'm not complaining, it feels like home here!  I've got a week and a bit now to sort out a few odds and ends, maybe even meet a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shit, I look like I just got washed in with the last wave. My hair is in dire need of a cut, before I get mistaken for a werewolf in the middle of beastial metamorphosis.  I need to shave too.  But then, who cares? :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This weekend I get to spend some quality time with my youngest brother Patrick, something the two of us never end up trying. Besides a busy Saturday it should be quite chilled. Can't wait to try some inline-skating with him, I suspect I've been skating a little more recently than him now, so we should be equally skilled.  Maybe it's time to try skating backwards or jumping!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next week Monday I'll be in Middleburg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mom got me a magnificent pair of binoculars for my birthday, Bushnell H20 10x42, completely waterproof.  They're fantastic.  I thought of omens, and dreams and how these binos are almost like the ticket across the Gibraltar for little Santiago.  Something used to follow a dream. Looking forward. Zzzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hey! Horizon! Come here!&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Constantly changing.  Cliches aside, it's time for a change, again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of updates, I hope this entry will suffice. Tomorrow I set off for Cape Town in the Scooby, with a flu. Maybe I should start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;How bad work can kill&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remember Shaun the flashy-international-traveller, and Shaun the hotshot-&lt;acronym title="User Interface"&gt;UI&lt;/acronym&gt;-goon? Well, he's gone for now. With all the excellent opportunities overseas, there came a price I didn't really want to pay: The Soul Destruction Tax.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I hear you asking: "Surely, when you're travelling, you enrich your soul?", and I'd have to nod and agree but that wasn't the case. When you're spending 6 out of 7 days working, and the seventh you're resting, it's hardly soul-enriching. My office had just been teleported to some fucked up island on the other side of the world.  I was the solution to a problem I didn't really have the desire to solve. I was far from home, in a selfish and uncaring country feeling so lonely it even showed in my work. Most would bury themselves in their work, but I rebelled instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"I want to go home, I've had enough of this!"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"OK Shaun, we'll see what we can do."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2 weeks pass - nothing.  A month passes, I'm finally back home.  A well-deserved holiday in Cape Town, sprinkled with more work - whilst on holiday.  Back to the UK.  Rinse-repeat. No Bleach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It eventually came down to me playing truant.  I was sick and tired of meeting the demands of a pompous hive-watcher and his cohort of relentless beareaucrats. So I started skipping work. Not the most tactful thing to do, I admit. My bosses back home didn't really care either, as long as I was raking in the dosh, they were happy. When the dosh was missing and reputation had been thrown down the well, alarm bells rang.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One well-deserved disciplinary warning later, I was set on a new course on a new local project.  But something was wrong.  It was the same old shit, just back home in SA.  My attitude, discipline and outlook had been riddled with bullets, Care was a wounded soldier in an unneccesary war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think I need some time off. And that is really starting tomorrow.  Enough of this &lt;acronym title="Massively Multiplayer Online"&gt;MMO&lt;/acronym&gt; crack and Same-Old-Routine&amp;trade;, I need big skies and fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;[VNW] Where to?&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A weekend in Cape Town to see Mom and Mike and possibly even go mountain biking in Stellenbosch. Then I'm back in the Scooby on Monday to find Middleburg in the Eastern Cape.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There, the co-ordinator for the Blue Cranes research project (funded by the &lt;a href="http://www.ewt.org.za/"&gt;Endangered Wildlife Trust&lt;/a&gt;) is waiting for me. I'm to spend 1-3 months in the Karoo, chasing Blue Cranes over farmland and grassland.  Inspecting habitant and possibly even doing something about it.  Meet the farmers, promote conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My first week will be spent inspecting and evaluating the effect of power-lines on the Cranes' habitat.  After that, it's down to raw census and flock identification.  You see, the Eastern Cape is like the Mecca for Blue Cranes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inbetween all this, I'll be staying with the Co-ordinator, Bradley and his family. I think it's an excellent opportunity to crack open the writing pad, watch the stars whizz by or just go for a spin on the Mountain Bike through farmlands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's all so intriguing, a chance to take myself out of the hurtful cycle and explore.  I know a few people who could do with such a change too, but you can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it swim.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Au revoir!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cosmic significance&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stars were out tonight, but the night was drawing to a close.
Daniels did one last perimeter check before dropping his guard and
slung gear, being extra careful with his Carbine. "These things have
a nasty tendency to think for themselves", Daniels muttered to
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a border-patrol scout on this hostile planet, Daniels displayed a
minimal sense of responsibility. The war had been ravaging this
planet for many moons, many lives were forced into early
termination on both sides. Daniels was a fresh recruit, with a
penchant for independence and an attitude to match. It wasn't
independence that brought this newblood to the surface of an alien
world, it was conscription veiled by the threat of silent execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumours whispered in the barracks and mess-halls of the makeshift
outpost that the republic was not here for wiping the enemy off this
stepping stone to Earth, but for a more clandestine reason:
Intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;
After the first few artifacts were found on Mars, and the invaders
appeared out of the planetary shadows, it became public knowledge
that there was more to this invasion than just taking over one's
house. What a coincidence that as you turn over a few pebbles on
Mars, the death-hungry spiders crawl out from underneath and feast
on your plump toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniels groaned as the clutches sprung away from the
inertial-drives deep within his augmented thighs, opening with a snap.
The headpiece, arm and torso units already lying in a heap next to
the biggest boulder he could find. Pressing iron on a regular basis
had certainly paid off as he effortlessly lifted himself out of the
still standing but lifeless legs.&lt;br /&gt;
Foot covers cast aside, it wasn't long before the long-johns and
sweat-shirt followed suit. The warm dry wind that had been
simmering all night felt amazingly good against his moist skin.
"Convection" Daniels thought to himself as he turned to face the
reason he abandoned his post, a massive, pristine lake, as far as
his cyborg-like eyes could see. With the starlight above, the water
looked just like quicksilver. Ominous, yet engrossingly beautiful. It
was 35 degrees celcius in the dark, but the water was refreshingly
cool as Daniels dipped his right foot into the wavelets.
Caution abandoned, Daniels crashed into the water in leaps and
finally a dive, submerging his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Childhood memories flooded back, memories of spending countless
hours in the family pool, till the fingers were like prunes and mom
had abandoned the boys to make supper.&lt;br /&gt;
Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waves soon turned to ripples, and soon too the ripples faded as
Daniels lay floating in his half-naked glory, face to the stars and
ears listening to the careful tunes the water had to play.&lt;br /&gt;
Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace was not something the Republic was accustomed to, Daniels
thought to himself, interrupting the serene kingdom he was now
ruling.&lt;br /&gt;
Mom always said evil begets evil. How long before Daniels too
abandoned reason for maliciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free minutes window was closing and the LZ was still a while
away. Daniels lifted his head and dropped his legs below the
surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sight before Daniels made him gasp, water flooding into his
gaping mouth. There she was, in all her virgin glory, Alpha Primary,
rising to the east. Daniels had seen many star rises on his sorties,
but nothing could prepare him for this cosmic co-incidence. For
there hovered the lone moon, just high enough off the horizon for
the virgin star to reveal herself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silvery chalice with a glowing red stem. The water reflecting the
spectacle in abstract perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That's it!" Daniels roared as he made a bee-line for his gear.&lt;br /&gt;
"That's fucking it!"&lt;br /&gt;
"That's why were here! I can't fucking believe it! I better tell the
guys!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniels' mood snapped into high-realism gear as he became aware
of 2 figures crouched by his abandoned power-armour.&lt;br /&gt;
Peace had gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For the wannabe king of pickled and dried plums&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dukey, thanks for the birthday wish. You rock! :) As for your meme, it's reached a Cul-de-sac unfortunately. So, here are my answers...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Seven Songs that Say Something to Shaun&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Tool - Vicarious&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Vast - Pretty When You Cry&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Audioslave - Be Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Mylo - Paris Four Hundred&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;The Crystal Method - Wild, Sweet and Cool.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Royksopp - So Easy&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Freshly Ground - I'd like&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strange that most of these songs remind me of someone or something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It's time to blog.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Might as well make it two entries in May.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;I want to let it out.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've got this worry inside me. Maybe not a worry, but a stirring thought. And it's got to do with singing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you think anyone can sing?  Do you think anyone can be trained to sing?  I feel like I'm a great singer, but there's something holding me back.  Heck, I'd even make a fucking good dancer, but I'd fear tripping over my own shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's there inside me, and I know it. I can feel it. Bottled up, catalogued and frustrated.  When I try sing, little bits squeak out, the cowards running for the hills. Half-hearted. Half-assed. Half-baked.  I can't sing in the shower, even when I'm home alone. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What correlations can be drawn from singing?  Isn't singing a happy thing?  Isn't singing extrovertion to the extreme? That's why I write, cos I can't sing or dance or bother trying either. Writing is opening up, singing to yourself, mostly in tune. It's beautiful, not because it's well received by others, but because it's the internal &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; being broadcast. A transcript of your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Comfort zones and 0.0 space&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I've been playing &lt;a href="http://www.eve-online.com/"&gt;EVE Online&lt;/a&gt; quite consistently for the last 2-3 months.  While other MMORPGs bore the shit out of me, this game is dynamic, because it could be considered alive.  The whole game is influenced by players and their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being space-based, the game is set in a massive galaxy of stars and their orbit items.  In the centre of this galaxy is a huge cluster of stars considered Empire Space.  Empire is where all the new players start out, it's considered safe for the most part, denoted by a 1.0 to 0.1 security rating.  On the outskirts of Empire spaces is 0.0 space.  There is no control out there, it's dangerous, treacherous but also bountiful and beautiful.  Untold riches await those brave enough to venture below it's veil of mystery.  Think of 0.0 as the hand of a young virgin.  Actually, scrap that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, playing for 2-3 months in this game is nothing. I've encountered my share of bad guys, but the risks were calculated and I survived.  The time has come to venture out into 0.0 space, a thought that terrifies me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why should it terrify me?  How alike is this to real-life where I'm scared of leaving my comfort zone, when I know it'll be better for me?  Could I pack my things and fly overseas to a fancy new job and meet different people?  Could I leave all I have behind and follow the sun to the horizon, on foot?  Why is hesitation synonymous with impending change?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Time to leave Empire me thinks.  If I can do it in a game, I can do it for real too, right? Guys? Hey? Where is everyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pouring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sit next to me here, whether our toes are dipped into the Atlantic or dangling over the edge of this ledge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sit next to me and listen. Sit next to me and talk to me. Open your heart and hear me. Hear me like I'm open all the way, a stream of emotion, feeling, adoration, honesty. Hold your hand in mine, interlock fingers, turn and face me, show me your eyes beneath your fringe hair playing seductively in the wind. When you talk I listen intently, but I'm also totally blown away by who you are, who you make me feel like.  I'm dumb and attentive at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel your warmth, thigh against thigh, but also shoulder to shoulder. Both looking forward but feeling toward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thought, word and deed.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How often does thought become word?  How often does thought become deed without the word.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm stuck at word.  All thought and word, but little deed.  Often I think about deed, and so I say so.  Often I just think without word.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One such thought has been plaguing my mind for a while now, but I dare not make it a word, or maybe not even a deed.  If I talk about it, I am helpless.  If I act upon that thought, I am beyond help.  Instead, it's trapped inside as a thought, a word and a deed. The thought of a word, the thought of the deed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Care to guess what my thought is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My own paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I'm staring at my reflection. One side lit by the bedside lamp, the other cast in shadow from my genetic hand-me-down.  I look with my eye bathed in the shadow and I see the other eye in the light.  I look with my eye cast in the light and all it sees is shadow where the other should be.  Why am I squinting at myself?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here... and it shows nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In the shadows I see twisting and contorting. My reflection of shadow is misleading and foul. In the light I see a tear form. I feel it burn up my skin as it drops away.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here... and it feels nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;My eyes are talking to me, each their own message.  On the one side I hear of grey, overcast skies, on the other the stories of adventure, experience and witness.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's a paradox at play here... and it says nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The waves come in fast.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Small troughs expose a rocky surface. Scratches till its sore.  Bleeds till it dies.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A MASSIVE CREST! Towering above me. Demeaning, impending white-wash doom.  Here I lie.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Watch how it's teeth are unsheathed. Jaws gape open, swallow me whole please.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Instead it rips and tears, my skin parts like a zipper, I fall to my knees.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Churn once inside, stew it up, heart and lungs. Add some spice, it's suppertime.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bubbling blood can't reach the brain but I can hear the deathbell chime.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Write of me and who I dreamt I could be and said I would be.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Tell your children I was the greatest, the boldest, the legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Think of me, bobbing here on this ocean, rinsing with the foam.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Think of me, weathering the storm, wishing I was home.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;*sigh*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;*calls in the sock elves*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Elf 1: Mmmm, I smell fresh sin!&lt;br /&gt;
     Elf 2: Yesss, yesss!  I smell it too&lt;br /&gt;
     Elf 1: Must be another of those murders...&lt;br /&gt;
     Elf 2: The last one was goood....  ten bucks says its over something stupid, like shares in a bristle cleaning factory.
    &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Elf 3 has run away with Shaun's sock while Elf 1 and Elf 2 are arguing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Elf 4 (Singing): Clap your hands and then hold your nose!  Bring the mops and the water hose!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Elf 3 (singing too): Grab a bucket! Grab a sponge! Take a bite before there's only grunge!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;*maniacal laughter*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Elf 4 (Singing): Wash it down from ceiling to floor.  Take the mess with us, out the door!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The elves disappear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     A faint humming can be heard in the distance, and then...&lt;br /&gt;
     A loud scream.
    &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;*Curtain*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     The crowd claps excitedly....&lt;br /&gt;
     "ENCORE!  ENCORE!" they shout as they rise from their seats
    &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;And as they stand, a shower of body parts comes crashing down along with the chandelier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The b-grade horror fliek ends.  Only static remains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A 3-pronged fork in the road.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The devil's fork.&lt;/strong&gt; 3 prongs, barbed with evil intent. One prong, an extension of the rod. The other two are deviations, yet still attached to the same rod. Your hand always goes on the rod, not the prongs.  Is one prong the extension of your handle?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The path beneath your feet.&lt;/strong&gt; Why is the path smooth? How does a choice of three seem equal if the road you're on seems to carry through to one of the choices?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your decision ability.&lt;/strong&gt;  Is your mind clear or clouded by frustration and its evil sister exhaustion? Is your will aligned with your feet and more importantly, your sense of smell?  Are those the smells of fresh pastures emminating from the prong on the right?  Or is the stench from the prong on the left overpowering your ofactory laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your gut.&lt;/strong&gt; Does it hunger for satisfaction.  Does it whisper ancient and guiding wisdom.  Does it feel lonely and forgotten.  Does your gut tell you that the stench you smell is actually the mind playing tricks on you.  Do you listen?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When faced with a choice of 2, isn't it a choice not to choose?  Why don't they put a motel and a sleaze bar here at this junction.  I could do with some stale beer and skanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shaun "The walking penis" O'Connell&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you see me drooling in public, like a terrier fascinated with a tennis ball?  When you speak to me, do your see an amorous look on my face and fluffy hearts floating upwards from the vent in my skull?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I ask you out to coffee are you really hearing me say: "Hey nice legs! Wanna fuck?".&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARE WE HAVING A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM HERE?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think I have a signal-intentions translation problem. I mean to ask you to coffee, and hey, if I like you more, and you like me too then we can talk about coitous, mmkay?  But until that point, please be assured my intentions are honourable, even for a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Observations of a tube user&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's been 3 months of using the London Underground on an almost daily basis.  Here follows an account of my experiences of the Tube.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Mommy says I shouldn't talk to strangers&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...and mom was right. Not a word is said on the trains, for fear of actually getting to know your fellow tube-child. Passengers are typically working-class citizens, going hurredly on with their days, inconvenienced by the mandotry tuna-tin slugfest. Like production line robots, people rail into the train, sit down, and tilt their heads down so they don't ever have to see anyone else on the train.  Granted, some take up reading or playing Sudoku, but most are zombies, not even butting their heads to the latest pop-crap playing through their iPods.  When the train stops at each station, (which is efficient for the most part) the inhabitants earnestly press on the open button, in the same way you press harder on a remote control button if it's not working correctly.  Is it hope that drives this action?  Is it a sense of achievement when the doors open up, after your commanding press?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;So many differnt shoes!&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The trains are living, breathing, stinky musuems for all kinds of footwear. From the flat canvas shoe to the thousand-pound custom-made business uniform end-pieces.  They say you can tell a person by what shoes they're wearing, but I wouldn't know.  It's rude (and dangerous) to talk to strangers.  Still, shoes pick up a lot of dirt in the tubes, so it's good to wear something practical and easy to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Transport for sheep&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shoes are useful for discerning the various species of train-folk. The most dominant of which is the North Boardroom Suited Sheep. Wooden hooves, black legs, large black torso and enough gel and cologne to even scare away an Italian.  They come in their droves, always trying to be busy (like checking their mulfunctioning mobile phone appendages) and clothed like they were born of a template. Flashes of colour are seen, but those individusals are strays.  The image that comes to mind: Mandrill, with black fleece and an appetite for vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Sound interference&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You would think with your headphones in place and iPod blaring away that you could actually drown out the screams and moans of the tube. (The aforementioned noises come not from the internals, but rather from the wheels on tracks.)  At times the static-like noise is overwhelming, deliverying trepidation and uncertaintity to its cling-ons. Not even the rageful sonnet in a Disturbed song can counter-balance the noise within.  Add fire, blatant humidity and 3 cups of evil-whoopass and I'm sure it would pass as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;...and yet, there is still hope.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the cracks of this plane of hell, are little beings at work. Tiny shrews emerge from the gaps between the huge advertising posters, scurrying about with food on the mind. Playing amongst the tracks and always knowing in good time before the train arrives.  These little rodents are not the only workers within the tubes.  I've heard rumours of Underground Staff actually coming down out of their booths to the rails below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you smile a genuine one and not one of those "I like your shoes, wanna have sex?" kinda smiles, people respond with a similar gritting-my-teeth-beneath-my-cool-exterior kinda smiles. I admint, I haven't tried winking at someone just yet for fear of being gnawed to death by the hordes of ravenous sheep. Wait, this is about hope isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And let us not forget the feeling you get when the cold winds are forced down the tunnels, creating a movie-like hair waving effect on all the willows by the banks of this river. It's truly surreal, and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Get from A to B, but please, don't take pictures!&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When someone else pays homage to the diced-carrots slash liquor gods, laugh to yourself. Understand that you too could be making a complete arse of yourself if sufficiently inebriated. (Not that you would care at that stage) Not that you should care anyway, but when with sheep, you must flock, or flock off.  The tube is a great uncaring, money-sapping monster. Swallowing time and basic human decency in its endless pursuit for the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sometimes words just aren't enough...&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of all the crap photos I've taken, the following get the point across.&lt;/p&gt;

The decor in this hotel was quite modern, it made for a welcome change from the clinical and sometimes boring.&lt;/p&gt;

A view out the window, Marble Arch is just off to the right.  Taken with my little camera and the wind-sill as a make-shift tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/London/lanky-lazy.jpg" alt="Lanky shows who's bed it really is" width="250" height="333" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice surprise.  Typically Lanky would be looking after my luggage, but house-keeping decided to plonk him slap-bam in the middle of my bed.  A touch of intuition and fun, don'tcha think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bobbys on the beat outside. Life put on hold.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today has been surreal.  I wasted 2 hours, found my alter-ego and gained 4 hours back. Now I just have to wait before life can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I tried to check out of the hotel this morning, bright and crisp at 9AM. A record for the month so far.  2 and half hours later, with a broken credit card and my optimist's tail between my legs, I finally managed to leave the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Work went OK.  Then work got a lot better when I started chatting to someone who not only interests me to the core, but seems so similar. We must have chatted about everything and then some. So involved, but thoroughly enjoyable.  And I ain't tellin' who it is! :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;7:30PM and it's time to get my bags and check into my new hotel, the Hilton London Paddington nogal. So I mission downstairs the way I usually do, open the front door and wham, then it hits me.  The smell of fresh pig. Well, no such thing. Foul Pig. There's a bobby outside my work door, and he won't let me out!  Apparently the whole street has been cordened off because of a suspicious vehicle and we're not allowed to leave the building till the police give us the go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, like curious children, my 3 late colleagues and I went upstairs and peeked out over the balcony.  The whole of Picadilly lane is closed off. Police tape everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel droopy from my intense hunger and exhausting day, exhausting both physically and emotionally.  Well, exhausted emotionally in a good sense.  I'm still thinking of the heart-to-heart-over-IP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've got an idea for a writing topic, watch this space.  And no, my muse is not a femme drenched in lust, but rather justamuse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;G'night and g'luck and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flying over france&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;What an atmospheric view! Clouds dotted below, like a silken-see-through-polka-dot-veil, pin pricks of light below.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;England on my left, France on my right.  An eery glow from the half-new moon sets the mood for the slow thoroughfare below and our speedy travel above.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Over France right now.  The patterns of light below seem the same as on the stinky island, up here even brits and frogs are alike. (Lest they be told).  On the British side, the lights by the channel are condensed and crowded, as if they were all fans pressed against a great fence, the stronger ones at the front holding back the poorer and weaker ones.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;How uncomfortable being so poor or so late.  All you can see are the shoulders and heads of those in front but not actually seeing.  Like religious fools too late for the initial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;France is light-less now, even the lights have gone to sleep at this early hour. 9PM, was it always early? Or is mankind and womankind setting their collective clocks later and later fuelled by the excitement and challenges laid out before us on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Passing&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Her hand bumps into mine and mine into hers.  We're passer-byes but the present allowed more time than usual.  Strange things happen when it's meant to be.  Her rich, brown hair spins out like a top as she turns around to see what her touch has alerted to. At first her eyes are scornful, lit by a fire of vigilante justice, she's out with the mob and the mob is hungry for blood.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Shielding eyebrows recede as reluctantly as they protected those eyes.  She's looking straight at me, first with that hellfire, then with a look reserved for those chapters describing first contact, first sight.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry" she flirts. I know she's not sorry, but then again, I don't even know her.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The mob takes over and soon she fades ino the mess of colours and sounds.  Inside I kick the dog, smash my guitar and curse the day I was made so helpless in the face of such opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Home&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There's something to be said about a month away from your normal and routine-driven life. Spending 2 weeks with the feet up or not having to worry about doing the daily grind was a cleansing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I put on 5 kilo's, caught a tan and opened my eyes. Now I'm struggling to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here's what I do remember though...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Home away from the house&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taking the bike down to Cape Town, in the back of the nDwagon turned out to be a good idea. One particular mountain biking trip came up trumps.  Starting at the bottom of the Durbanville hills in a place called Magic Forest, we ascended amongst the vineyards.  It was a tough climb, grinding in first gear.  The weather was perfect for mountain biking, overcast with a slight breeze. I had to stop numerous times to get my breathe back, it had been ages since my last trip on the bike.  The horizon unfolded infront of us as we reached the high-point, marked by a Trig Beacon. Getting off the bike and looking around was a totally surreal experience.  The clouds were just high enough to see the expansive Kranseberg to the north-east, which we could see all the way from Franschoek to Gordon's bay in the South.  Layers of saucer shaped clouds intersected the mountains, making them look larger than normal, as if their peaks prodded out from the clouds.  We could clearly see Gordon's bay opening up before being obscured by another of the Durbanville Hills.  Looking further to the right, we saw the top of Table Mountain jut out from the rolling hills, smothered in the table-cloth. The dull but streaked grey clouds above meant the colours came out more saturated, something that looked even better through the sunglasses.  It was at about that time that I kicked myself for not bringing the camera. It's not everyday that the smog is in hiding and the clouds pay homage to the vista before you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The trip back up to Jo'burg was very similar to the trip down.  Only this time I spent the next morning on the north eastern side of Kimberley at the much nicer Road Lodge.  That morning I woke up semi-early, had breakfast then went out on the mountain bike again.  The Road Lodge overlooks a huge pan, which during certain times of the year is invaded by flocks of Flamingos.  Taking the bike alongside the railway tracks in the blazing 10AM heat wasn't so fun, but being able to edge up to the water and see the Flamingos up close was worth every ounce of lost water.  Returing to the hotel I was being circled by a Fish Eagle, its distinctive call breaking the monotony of the cicadas and finches.  Bliss, and on a bike too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Jo'bag, revisited&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being back in Jo'burg feels like I'm back in the same old routine. I don't like it.  Friends make up for it though, it's been great to see the old buddies again. I think I've been spoilt by a great holiday in Cape Town and living in fancy hotels overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Work here is proving more taxing than normal, mostly because of dealing with connection issues and work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Looks like I'm off to the UK for another work-related month, starting this Saturday. If I'm lucky, and my cards play as they should, I should be spending a week in Norway with my cousin Ingunn.  Regardless, I'm just not in the right frame of mind this time for the UK.  It feels like an empty or worthless chore this time, the novelty worn out just like a cheap lucky-packet prize loses it's appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to say more, but now is just not the time. I want to escape. Anonymous and friendly comments keep me going. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following happened almost a month ago...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;A belly full o' lovin'&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wish I could marry my mom.  She puts so much effort into those around her, an effort often times that slips by unnoticed. She's that someone throwing the ball back over the wall or handing a lost wallet into lost and found.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Its been a slog of a few days, primarily due to my joburger sunburn getting me down. Here I am in the most beautiful city in South Africa, it's summer and I have to cower indoors like a vampire.  The sunburn has taken 4 painful days to dissipate and now I'm peeling like I'm cold blooded.  Sif.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;10 days ago I left Joburg in my lonely car for Cape Town.  It was a 2 day journey for me.  I stopped off in Kimberley after the first 4-5 hours of driving.  I had my bike packed in the car, so as soon as I was rooted in Kimberley, I got the bike out and took a sojourn through this odd capital of the Northern Cape.  A brief cycle to the "Big Hole" was not only good fun but stirred many schoolhood memories of our trip to Kimberley.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I cycled back to the porta-hotel or Hotel Formula 1, the heavens opened. How odd to be in the dry Northern Cape and experience the fury of a Joburg thunderstorm. That night Tom Robbins and I sat at a busy table and ate a rather mushy and disappointing burger.  He told me of the story of perfume, but I was too distracted by the funny accents and children running through the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having a car with a decent stockade of fueled-power was a welcome ally on the lengthy Karoo trip.  I was up early and eager to continue my journey.  Queens of the Stone Age, Live, and a few other loud bands played, I sang along to keep myself occupied.  The numerous trucks and idiotic caravan drivers kept me alert though, so before I knew it I was in Laingsberg where I met Andre and Theuns who had just left Cape Town 2 hours earlier.  Was good to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Driving through the Hex River Valley and De Doorns on the Silver nDwagon was an experience I'll battle to forget. It's breathtakingly beautiful coming from the arid Karoo, stepping through the portal and being shown the awe and birth of the Berg with its green vineyard laden valley below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A short trip after that and I was parked in front of my mom's new house in Vredekloof.  I parked my ass down and 2 beers later I was in total relax mode.  *sigh* I felt like I was home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;If you dream your available wife is pregnant but you're constantly thinking of someone else, someone more attractive, what does that say if your so single?  So single.  So single it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Like a stupid fucking stun gun that can't arc, one electrode gunning for it's missing partner.  Pushing those electrons out into the nothingness in the awkward hope they'll find home, find their salvation, ascend.  Even electrons have to be useful.  What happens to electrons that are lost?  Do they hold a charge? Or do they get locked up with the bums and strays of this life?  Does the partner electrode actively seek these electrons or do the electrons find her?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The dumb flower with it's petals sown shut. The pollen inside busting to fulfill it's sole purpose. Sown so shut the bees can't fucking smell the prizes within.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The moronic tap that drips at night, the valve shot from too much pressure over too much time. It's purpose eroded.  Shouldn't all taps just flow? Why do they need to hold back the surge of goodness within?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Open the tap, naive girl.  I have a handle, use it.  I'm built for one purpose, to fulfill you. "Je suis a toi."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The calm after the storm...&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's been a reflective and terrible week again.  Why is it I always blog to say how crap it's been :(&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The reason for the total crapness all came to a head on Tuesday Morning.  I spent a grand total of 17 hours at the office on Monday, which culminated in a document being sent off to the client 5 hours before the window closed.  I got back to my hotel, groggy for exhaustion at 4AM and decided they won't see me on Tuesday, especially after losing half of Sunday to work too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yesterday was spent suffering from a vision related migraine but was also spent with thoughts swimming through my head.  Obscure, dream induced thoughts.  As if my subconcious was melting into my conciousness at times. (When ever I think of melting, I think of Kerry, Lost in Japan at this very moment).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think some much needed toursit time is due this weekend.  It'll be my last weekend in London before I jet back late on the 9th... Maybe a walk around the Thames in the cold, or a visit to the Tate Modern.  This canvas needs some footprint dabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Friday night spurred the eternal questions around being happy. How does one "look" for happiness? Can you even look for happiness?  Isn't happiness like the Tao would preach: "No attachment to material things" or is it more subtle than that, a balance. I'm inclined to think the latter, and sitting here being a baker is not helping at all.  I need to go out there and find my path and just follow it. I need to find out who I really am inside cos I've been getting hints of it for too long now.  Some suggest finding that head-space, 3 months of absolutely nothing, no time constraints, no being tied down. Maybe that's why Tibet is the world's most popular backpacking nation in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Happiness is internal appreciation, the ice floating in the fizz of your coke on a hot summer day. Happiness is sharing a smile and getting one back. Happiness is knowing you're loved and loving others just as hard and then some.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The sun is lazy today, just doing enough work to keep the chill at bay.  Moderately warm they say.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Wind: a hurried messenger, fueled by the cold of the arctic waters and it's temperate-under-the-collar customer miles inland.  Always running, never stopping to ask how I am.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Soft sand whisked up in the stress of the trafficking wind forms long lines across the beach.  Holding hands, these strands of sand never letting go of their peers, their families, their lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Tired feet massaged by the receding sandy water underneath, gurgling as each step passes. The now defunct sandals bundled together in my left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Her dress seems to play with the wind, curling itself around the pressure and turning it into something graceful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Signing off with the following: Someone special popped into the world this day, her beautiful brown eyes seen for the first time by her obviously proud parents, is it 23 years ago? *grin* Happy Birthday Carla!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A road (bad) trip&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This dream happened just before 7:40AM on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mike (my brother) and I go collect Garth and Ross Taylor.  We haven't sen them in years.  I'm driving mom's old Fort Cortina, the one we used to dread driving in Snobville.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We arrive in good time and they hop in. It feels like we're driving back home at this stage, and for some reason I'm incredibly nervous about my driving ability, especially having 3 peers in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We stop off somewhere first, all get out, then get back in again.  I feel terribly uncomfortable in my driving position. The seat feels awkward. My brother is sitting behind me yet it's Garth who's knees are digging into the back of my seat. He sarcastically remarks: "Yeah, it's uncomfortable hey?!".&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We're driving through the back streets of Bryanston and Randburg.  I'm driving slowly, perhaps too slow. Other road users behind me are upset, showing their disappointment in my rearview mirrors. I ignore them.  My vision ahead seems obscured. As I make sense of the impairment, its a great big red model double-decker bus perched just behind my steering wheel (on the steering column).  I try sit up straight and can only just see a bit further.  By leaning to the left I can see much better.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I feel like I'm outside the car, but still in full control. The car is no longer mom's old Ford, but a corsa or some other hatchback. Even red in colour.  I'm looking down at the car.  We're dodging stationary cars, garden service bakkies and stopping for oncoming traffic.  The road users behind me are getting incresingly irritated, one particular individual looks like a rough Harvey Keitel, shaggy jaw, scruffy hair.  When I slip into the oncoming lane, the cars behind me surge ahead of our car in the left lane. Three cars pass, the Harvey Keitel look-alike first, another car and then an old man with thick glasses easily visible.  When the old man passes he uses his hazards to say: "Thanks!", I sarcastically say to myself: "Pleasure old man" and pull a Banzaaai hand sign.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I've got an easy right turn ahead, one I've travelled many times before as it seems quite familiar. Our slow speed is actually too fast for the turn and I miss the apex.  The car trips into a slide, by looking over my left shoulder I can see a house's gate approaching fast. The car stops spinning at 180 degrees but is still sliding backwards.  I work the controls of the car and we stop centimetres from the gate.  I knew it!  I knew we'd miss it!&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;My passengers were obviously distressed but I blow it off, trying to act all confident, inside I feel terrible again.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As we head into the dip after resuming our course, the Harvey Keitel wannabe tries to tell me something from the side of the road.  I can't tell if he's pissed off with me and wants a confrontation or if he has something to point out to me about the state of my car. (like it could have had a flat or a non-working tail light).  I blow him off again and carry on with the driving. As we descend into the dip, I can see a huge sandbank on the right-hand side.  Our road now has two choices, an early right turn up the embankment or continue on the left (which Garth and Ross reveal later was the better way to go).&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I take the right turn up the sand bank and am outside the vehicle again, looking down at the car and the road ahead.  Dodging the severe bumps and making my own road of the sand and grass.  I reassure the passengers again by pointing out a dirt road ahead of us, headed in the right direction too.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I'm back inside the car again with my right arm out the window catching air. My hand touches an over-hanging power-line, I didn't feel any electrical current (thank goodness) just the cold steel.  We're now at a cliff-top and there are powerlines everywhere, I grab onto another power-line and now all 4 of us are out of the car, dangling from the lines, worried about which cable to hold onto. The car feels like it's down in the water below.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A human ladder is the agreed best way off the power lines, but the powerline we're all holding onto starts to sag, we're headed for the water below.  Fear overcomes me.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As we touch the water a massive surge of electricity courses through the line.  I wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Seventeenth of the Eleventh and a week&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Looks like my trip has been extended till the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of December.  I'm not happy about this. It's starting to snow elsewhere in England, only a matter of time before it hits London.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let's see, in the lsat week, I've had to work, worked and then worked some more. Saturday I was sick and still had to work, Sunday I went to see my cousin Donja and her new family.  Amazing what can happen in 5 years :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of you know just how much I detest contracting to this company, well, I had to chuckle at the following. Their head office is near Slough in a place called Egham. Slough is reknowned for its terrible attitude.  On the BBC, they're running an experimental TV program called: "Making Slough happy".  I don't think that'll help this shit company :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the emotional front, I got an excellent interpretation for the last dream I posted. And subsequently had another hectic dream, which I might post later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tuesday presented an excellent opportunity to do some ad-hoc writing, so please, pull up a seat and tell me what you think...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sitting in a laundrette, reading my book which is open on a chapter titled "Happiness". Trying to balance a chocolate brownie and the book, totally cosumed by the book while I consume the brownie, totally. Bits of brownie spill on the pages below, rich chocolate brownie bits. My mouth pitiful for the missing pieces now strewn and smudged on the pages.  The smudges have somehow avoided the text as most of the crumbs descended into the valley created by the pages.  That's what it is, a fold between mountains, a fertile valley slit in two by an angry river.  In the next valley, a new story is waiting to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The windows to the laundry are all steamed up, the dryers are running at full tilt after being industriously loaded by the resident physiotherapist.  A man of small stature. A man with a smile and outlook to balance how he is perceived on the outside.  He has a pseudo-Italian accent, it reeks of English abuse, maybe even colonialisation.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The hum of the dryers is soothing to the inmates, that is except when the loose change and plastic buttons don't knock against the glass windows. No silk shirts or expensive trousers here, this laundry is a place of worship to the meek.  Tokens of gratitude will have to amuse the gods for another few minutes, the gods reacting with brewing thunderstorms and they're cleansing rain.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A cycle of life within this 25 square meter establishment.  In go the vital ingredients for its existence, out goes the byproduct. The entire process bringing a sense of accomplishment to all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Didn't finish so well, but it was still a good feeling to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Seventeenth of the Eleventh&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Void, Null. One can't even shake an adjective out of the mental lucky packet to describe the last week. I'm losing track of my days. Anyway, this should break the 10 day drought. Last night, around 3:30PM I woke up after another whacky dream.  I had my notepad and pen at the ready so jotted it down in the semi-dark.  Here...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I'm with a family, the father figure reminds me of Bill Cosby, in fact, the whole family reminds me of the Cosby family. Bill's oldest daughter has a crush on me, she's shy for an 18 year old. There is someone else with me at the Cosby residence, a small complex unit in a beautiful autumn park estate.  This person feels like a guardian and observer, maybe even a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We leave the Cosby house and as we walk out the front door onto the common pathway / roadway, Bill's oldest daughter runs after us so we turn and face her and her mini-entourage of younger brothers and sisters.  She approaches and gives me a light kiss, then shyly recoils.  Her younger siblings giggle in their innocent ways.  She's blushing.  I face her and step closer, and she darts inside after putting a puzzled look on her face.  The younger ones chuckle and follow her into the house.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I turn for the gate again. I look down to see that all the gardens are demarcated with hundreds of those hang-up knives and forks.  You know, the ones with plastic handles that you can hang on a 6-item rack.  All the metal bits are shoved into the ground, acting as mini-picket fences for the gardens in the complex units.  I pull one out, the fork itself is huge! Twice the normal size at least.  Our curiousity fades, so we walk to the complex entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The complex itself is open-air, well spaced lots with tall Oak trees, Oak trees with hardly any branches at the lower regions, just tall trunks at eye level. It's autumn, so some golden leaves are perched on the bright green grass. It feels like it's over-cast, but that could be the trees blocking the light.  I don't look up, just down.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bill's youngest son (aged 8-10) has been running after us and finally catches up. He's playing the messenger boy for his father, we're to see the old man as soon as possible. A brief walk back to the Cosby house ensues. When we meet Bill inside, he asks us what happened to the 6 chocolate muffins we bought (at Woolworths).  I don't really know the answer but I say: "I gave them to the children", lying about his kids, when I really mean I gave them to the children of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; time we leave the Cosby's. This time our walk takes us on an elevated road within the complex.  High grass embankments on either side. Now I feel like I'm at a lake-side holiday resort, it feels Drakensberg-ish, but I can't see any of the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Our road out has a view over a lake-side road, within a stone's throw. To the right I hear a mighty freeflow exhaust sound, I say to my walking partner: "I know this car, it has a lot of power!".  As it reveals itself from the right of my view, it looks like a bright yellow Toyota Conquest, but more "boxy".  It has racing stickers all over it, with a bold navy blue 3 word phrase down the door panels, one of the words I can make out to be: "Acton". Perhaps a company name. [For some reason I'm associating this with the "Speend and Sound" livery I've seen on Subaru's.]  As the car barrels down the road, I can now see that it actually has 8 wheels, 2 per axle with huge yellow rims, like tyre-less LEGO wheels. No rubber evident per wheel.  The car makes a stuttering sound and the driver inside brings it to a halt right in front of us. Grating the gears, it groans as he picks up the revs.  Instead of going forward, the car shunts abruptly in reverse, the driver hesitates then carries on going in reverse. Now the driver is not inside anymore and replaced with an overweight black man, dressed in a navy, sky blue and white basketball jacket and NY Yankees cap.  He's sitting on top of the car as if it was a Go-Kart. What happens next really confuses me.  As he's going in reverse, the car flips up onto one set of 4 wheels, with the other 4 in the air.  He's driving it backwards with the car on the left side of wheels and the weight of the car on his road-bearing head.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The dream ended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do you think it means?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>
&lt;h3&gt;Add no infinitum please...&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So anyway... that last blog was pretty sif. Sorry :/&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm slowly plodding through the novel / handbook Nicole gave me on "The Right to Write".  The book is pocket-plethora of inspiration for writing, but I just haven't committed to doing any.  I'd rather read the book than break the reading-chain-of-thought by switching to the PC or paper.  Watching TV is also bad for progress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many themes on the book touch on coincidental aspects of my own life, or how I even started looking at writing.  A good example is how I used to write to myself to "show" those mean people a thing or two. Emotion fuels writing.  Another example is how a simple walk on your own outdoors can open up ideas or bring clarity to those that seemed obscure.  All in all let's just say Nicole is an inspired gift giver :)   I love designers :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Continuing on my theme of London, this weekend was action packed...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I got up early (or rather tried to :D) for breakfast and subsequently took the tube to South Kensington Station.  A short walk through the subway and I emerged at the entrance to the &lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/"&gt;Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; just after 11:00AM.  The free entrance was a welcomed surprise, as was the content of the museum. The museum had two fancy exhibits on, the &lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/wildphoto/"&gt;Wildlife photographer of the year&lt;/a&gt; as well as a massive diamond exhibit. I must have spent over an hour in the Wildlife Photography exhibit, most of the photos were truly awe inspiring.  Some examples and some thoughts below...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/gallery/image.jsp?image=3505"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/gallery/pictures/26.jpg" alt="The chimp" width="342" height="231" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That feeling you get when you've had a long tiring day, that nothing else can go wrong because the worst has already happened, when you step outside and it starts to rain.  You laugh at yourself, getting wet like a fool but you're enjoying it. Like the freedom after a slog through the sewerage at Shawshank, stripped to the bone of your humanity, exposing the realness of you.  Embrace the heavens, embrace the giver of life your soul liberated, your smile extended, your conviction exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...and...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/gallery/image.jsp?image=3519"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/gallery/pictures/12.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="228" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settled, rejuvenated. Ready for the next leg of this life-journey. Your past echoing behind you, the future calling before you. Potential born in each one of us, potential to fail in the frost or ascend on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I guess you could picture me smirking like an idiot when I came across the chimp reaching for the termites, in the packed exhibit area.  These little captioned images do little justice for the grandeur I was presented with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rest of museum was good, especially the gem-stone and life-sciences areas. I intended to visit the Science museum too, but it was already 3:30PM and my back was killing me from standing all day.  I got back to the hotel, chilled for a while and gathered my strength for a night out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First stop was Battersea Park for the annual Guy Fawkes Fireworks evening. 2 beers, 20 minutes of fireworks and a brandy-'n-coke later I was feeling alive.  So was my bladder, I was busting for a piss. :D  After a train trip back to Victoria Station I was bursting at the seams so headed off to the loo's while everyone else shot the proverbial breeze.  Afterwards we headed to one of the local pubs until they kicked us out at closing time. The rest of the evening was spent having cocktails and shooters over Monopoly and Music.  The Monopoly didn't go down so well, but the music, booze and the friendly banter sure did! :D I got back to the hotel just before 4:30AM, another great night in the bag!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sunday I chilled in the hotel lounge to a cappucino and an awesome burger, completing games of Sudoku in all the provided newspapers. (I'm such an addict :D)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That's the end of another sif entry. Thanks for payin' and stayin'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Friends take the gloom outta London&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The last two nights have been spent with good friends, indulging in decent food, sharing bottles of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I jumped on a tube train or three and got out at Victoria Station, a short walk and a return ticket later, I was on the train to Clapham Junction.  Here, I met up with Gareth and a few of his friends at a pub called "The Fine Line".  One too many Grolsch's later, I found myself playing chicken with the cars whilst heading back to the train station, a spring in my step and getting weird glances from passer-bys.  I blame the overly loud Queens of the Stone Age album screaming in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last night was just as good.  Its not everyday you can hook up with some old buddies and take off from where you left, as if time was immaterial.  I hadn't seen Jennie for almost 5 years, and Chief for 2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They made the move to London about 3-4 years ago and haven't looked back.  It got me thinking about my time in London so far, which under the circumstances, has been quite poor. It seems job opportunities for my line of work are literally bursting at the seams.  I'd be stupid to ignore them but could I really live here?  Maybe I can earn pounds in SA :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All in all, let's just say the last two days have been much better!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;London itself, after a week.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gloom, as I said earlier, has equal presence as the number of hot spanish girls. People draped in dark jackets and coats, the only bustle of colour coming from the odd tie or eccentric old bat.  I've never seen so many suits in my life before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The buildings look run-down and repeatedly restored plus rained-on for ages.  Imagine mounds of dark red earth with visible erosion marks stretching from the top down.  Now add a building image over the mound of earth. Get the picture?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The tree's leaves are just starting to turn red.  With the office being directly opposite Green Park, it makes for a beautiful morning walk from Green Park station to the offices on Piccadilly Lane. That is, when I'm not dodging the other panic stricken pedestrians and the hell-cabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tube stops are odd.  The people on the trains dare not stare, smile (and therefore laugh) let alone talk to strangers.  Instead, everyone is frowning at their own shoes, or trying to make it look like they're reading the paper.  The busiest time I've been on the tubes has been at 6:30 and is NOT an enjoyable experience.  Carrying a laptop on a crammed train left me checking my laptop bag every 10 seconds. There are ALWAYS people bumping into you.  By the time you get off the tube, your nasal passages have been invaded by a black soot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I haven't tried the buses yet and was told I should.  We'll see, right now I'm happy being a creature of habit. :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Weather has been good apparently. (Yes, Apparently!) Most of my time has been spent in the office, or sleeping, so I can't really comment :D  It did rain badly the one day, which proved highly irritating.  Thankfully I had my massive rain-jacket with me so avoided being totally soaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A few weeks in a strange place&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There's nothing more disappointing than listening to one of your favourite CD's, but one that's been scratched with estrogen induced fury and fingernails.  How can the best vocalists stutter like idiots?  How can the best guitarists strum like 3 year olds?  It just doesn't make sense.  It's not the chaos of it, it's the order of the chaos of it. It's like when black and white mix and have grey mutant babies.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's the expectation of it all, you expect your favourite music to play perfect, to satisfy, instead it disappoints to the point where you need to find something else to satisfy you.  Booze?  Drugs?  Hermit-dom?  Try writing.  Once again, it's the high expectation, and we're not talking about a drug-induced high, we're talking setting your sights on something unreachable, well, not quite. Not unreachable, but just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"KAAARRRRMAAA Police, arrested this man, he talks in math, he buzzes like a fridge, he's like a day-dream-radio."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"KAAARRRRMAAA Police, arrested this girl, her hitler hairdo, it's making me feel ill and we have crashed her party."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"This is what you get."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"This is what you get."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"This is what you get, when you meehh-ess with uuuuus."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Foooorrrr a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself!"&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;... but now I'm back, damn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have R17k worth of holds on my credit card. Yay. Like a fool, I persist with my stay in my 140 pound per night hotel and its 15 pound breakfasts, all in the blind hope that my contract holders will pay it back, as they should.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The work is incredibly frustrating, I can't do my work, because it's too premature. It's like trying to build the scale model with no plans to work off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's 1AM, and I still need to get a few thoughts outta my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whizzer&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We're on the train again, a route done a few times already.  The lights whizz by, always in straight lines, always till the glass starts to warp the light into the nothingness of the window frame. The lights are like fireflies perched on leaves, while I cycle madly through the forest, yes, at night. A light is hope in the darkness, a signal for your loved one to come home safely to. A warning for the demons to stay at ten paces and not approach for fear of their own oblivion. Cos even demons fear oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Different coloured lights, some burning like fire others burning the synthetic wick inside, fueled by the rare gases that make up our own intake too. Whites as hot as 6 watts and silvery blue burn holes in my eyes and leave their children behind, like a mother wasp. Only these children are quickly smeared and their messy entrails leave long stains down the direction I'm going. I'm not in control of this bicycle, instead, its the space between the lights that guide my vehicle down a path that I know of, but can't control. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful evening.  It's 12PM, I'm on an hourlong train out of London to my tireless bed in Newbury.  My evening was shared with my chinese colleagues and one special spanish dear, Alesha. We invaded a crampy italian restaurant a stone's throw away from the corner of James and Bond Street in central London.  The food was great, but then I've always been a sucker for Lasagna, just like Garfield.  It wasn't long before the topic of chinese names came up, and how to draw (or rather write) your name in chinese.  Often, like in native american culture, the chinese give associative names to their western peers.  While Alesha went outside to grab a smoke, I asked my comrades for Alesha's chinese name.  "Li Wei" they said, or rather, "Lee Way".  On a clean napkin with a special pen, Jing scribed Alesha's name with artistic flair. Alesha got back and we presented her with her new name. Li Wei means: Beautiful Smile. Alesha wore her name with great fervour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Soon the tables were turned, and the topic of my own name came up. "Shaun" is very similar to a chinese word for the 9th layer of sky. "Tian Xiao" or, reaching for the sky with great speed. A metaphor for my experience on this trip. Jing later remakred, that because I was so tall, my name had more meaning that just the sound of Shaun in chinese.  Mmm, cheesy. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Feel alive&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We left the blinds open last night. It was too hot anyway to close them. This morning, the sun rose as it normally did but unabashed, casting its rays on our sleeping faces.  It wasn't long before the orange built up behind our eyelids and woke us gently. I remember opening my eyes to see you still sleeping, facing me, half your beautiful face buried in the pillow. When you sleep, you smile - A content smile. I smiled too.  That's the magic of us, even in such little ways do we find joy from and with one another. I must have smiled a tad too bright, because at that moment you woke to see me smiling at you. Your eyes glinted, sparks flew. You make me feel wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;With an underhanded slap, you pulled the covers over our heads, grinning the way you do, such a naughty grin. The sheets are cool and feel great on our relaxed frames. The rush of warming air and the smell of you permeate my senses. Your hands are soft and just the right tempreature.  Not too hot to be glowing like our passion, or too cold to make me recoil.  Just right.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Your hair is wild but still behaving. I love your rich hair, your essence flowing around you. So soft to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Toes and feet start to play at the exposed end of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The phone rings. It's your boss, you need to come into work earlier than normal. You're disappointed, but I'm gloating to myself.  I'm in love with one respected in her career, she's so busy but she always makes time for me. I know that she loves me more than amount of effort she puts into her work, which is beyond the call of duty anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The kettle boils.  You love the way I make you that special coffee and deliver it to you in my boxers. If coffee had meaning, this cup was laden with adoration. I would wake at any hour to deliver you this special coffee just to see that expression on your face as you take the first sip.  It's the hot thrill, warming satisfaction you get.  I recall the way you kiss me when you pull the cup to your lips. Like a dumbstruck kid, I watch you sip your coffee in total fascination.  Don't look at me like that, or you'll be late for work! :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nicole is someone special, she's like the sister I never had. She and I work well together. For my birthday this year, she got me two inspired and inspiring little books, one "The Pocket Muse" and the other, a book on "The Right to Write".  Chapter 1 of the Right to Write has the following exercise...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Describe how and what you are feeling right now. Write about anything and everything that comes to mind. Be whatever and however you are at this moment. Get current. Feel the current of your thoughts and emotions. Here goes...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Beat. Beat. Something I suck at. Something I wish I could improve. I dream of making music, writing lyrics, making others feel how I feel when I hear and recognise an awesome song. One such song is Guano Apes - Quietly. Heh, it reminds me of someone special, who said she had given me the song, when I know it was other way round. She's fun like that. The song itself has meaning through its rhythym. The drumming is not a fixed rhythym, but rather natural. Like a heart beat is not just a blip-blip-blip, it has a recognisable wave, yet each one is unique, like a snowflake. How does a heartbeat represent a snowflake? A snowflake is shaped out of the chaos of winds, water and particles in the air. A heartbeat is the order in our chaos. it's consistent. You'll always have snowflakes in snow. Isn't a snowflake the heartbeat of a winter's storm? Isn't the heartbeat the source of life? Both governed by laws we don't fully understand. A snowflake is naturally beautiful, just like a heartbeat. It's just there, it just exists, it shows us that even the smallest things have the greatest meaning, that we cannot underestimate the simple things in life. You are my snowflake, my heartbeat. You melt in my hands, you pulse in my hands. You're amazing. You're the source of my inspiration, my energy, my willingnes to live. You remind me that I'm alive. I listen to my pulse. Beat beat beat.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The song changes. It's more chilled. Yellow. Yellow is the colour of cowards, of warning, of sweetness.  Yellow goes well with shades of red, black and sometimes blue. Black and blue. Bruising. Injury. Thoughtless action. Rewind, always rewinding to the moment to find out what went wrong. Why? Accidents happen. Accidents make you stronger. Life without accidents, faults, errors would be pretty, pretty boring. Accidents remind us we're human, we're allowed to make mistakes. We're not allowed to make them happen again though. Some people live perpetual accidents. Dodging one accident to have another. Like lying. If you lie, you're permanently having accidents. Do things right or don't do them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday Mike. May you have many more than me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Frustration (I'm sure I've used this word before)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well well, my UK trip was delayed for another week, becuase the client wasn't ready.  Which is good I guess, gives me more time to organise goodies before I make like an instinctless bird, flying north into winter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This time, the adventure will be different.  I'll have my own friends to chill with over weekends and I'll be going on my own.  They always say that if you go on your own somewhere, you're bound to come out with more friends.  I certainly felt this on my last trip to the US.  Heck, I even asked someone special out on a date!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the negative side, it means everyone thinks I'm in the UK already.  (I'm sure you can picture the MSN transcripts.)  It's my own fault for being so energetic about the whole thing, heh.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A week's delay also means another week of driving the scoob.  It's going to be 3 weeks soon since I got it.  Amazing how quick time flies, especially when you're having fun. :)  Mike and Mom offered to sell my old car down in Cape Town and even organised a friend to drive it down for me.  It certainly lifted a lot of weight off my shoulders knowing it's in their capable hands.  I love you mom! :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clutch control proved a problem initially, especially for my oogle-eyed passengers. I had numerous complaints from one person specifically.  No names mentioned. Granted, it was my second day of driving the noobwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What a boring entry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Everyday I see you before my vision clouds over, obscured by thoughts I dare not mention to you. My hand itches at the prospect that it could be on the back of your shoulder, light touch.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Do you know that when you smile at me, you're killing me inside?  It's like a cancer getting a push toward the oblivion of it's host. Do you know that when you look at me the way you innocently do, you're burning holes through me?&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Maybe you're not so oblivious, maybe you're actually playing me for the sucker I am. If I ever find out, I'll be morose for the fact that I've spent so much energy on one so thought and care less.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;While you might know or think that I know and think you're my everything, you're also my everything because I'm truly alive when I love you.  It's selfish that way but you bring out the best of me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This one for a friend who's leaving for Canada, like forever.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;If touch could be a messenger. Imagine! Even a fingertip to exposed skin is an explosion of emotion. A conduit for deep thought, a goddamn expressway of expression. Trucks on roids, cascade down the lanes delivering their payload. Their drivers crazy, keeping up a frantic pace, tired from the concentration required all this time.  At the end of the route, salvation, reward and of course frothing cold beers served by big-tittied wenches.  Not one driver knows what his iron steed has been hauling, only that the delivery is important and well paid for.  The source, well known.  The destination, dangerous.  Damn these drug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trying new things&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In about 30 mins time, I'll be off to Illovo, to attend my first session at the Chatillon Institute.  Sounds complicated, but basically Monsieur de Chatillon (and he prefers being called that) presents a lecture on Carl Jung's work. Any aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For those that are too lazy to google Carl Jung, or look him up in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, he was a Swiss Psychiatrist specialising in the darker aspects of human behaviour.  Specifically the subconcious, dream symbology and other unexplored aspects that make up: us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should be a nerve-wracking first lecture, as I haven't been to any form of school for close on 7 years.  Scary hey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I can see now&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm so tired I've been squiting to read this as I type.  Thank goodness for corrective measures with hefty price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've been recently self-diagnosed as a hermit.  It's OK, they like me here, the cooking sucks though.  The last two months have been in a total mindless and repetitive state, no, Ohio even.  I've been chasing my pegasus as well as battling mediocrity.  Two noble yet thoroughly pointless endeavours.  I've been missing my writing, and reading, and socialising. And all those other normal non-hermit-like activities.  Guess one doesn't write or read in groups though.  Scratch that from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was browsing through some old photos, listening to some sombre music, when I literally cracked.  At the office too.  That's not healthy.  No one saw me though.  That's healthy.  So many memories welling up inside me, my brim battling to contain the surge.  Missing loved ones, totally unhealthy food, and the scent of adventure on the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Crutches in armpits, full weight bearing down the alumninium struts.  How funny the tracks must look in the sand.  A walking tripod with rubber feet. Tracks, articificial tracks, no scent to discern. Tracks that lead nowhere, just plodding on. It's not the destination, it's the action.  A noun, not a verb, fool. Comma abuse, I should be locked up, chained down and interrogated sideways.  Too many questions hurt my overcrowded brain.  My roads are full of ditches and potholes. There's no water on tap or electricity on plug, or is that socket. It's now twenty to bed-time, but I don't want to sleep.  But I do.  It's the waking I don't want to do. To sleep, perchance to have persistent nightmares. Sick. Where is my doctor?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introspection&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2 days ago, I had a strangely serene dream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Russia, or some Eastern European Country.  Slovakia?  We're driving in what feels like a Mercedes G-Model 4x4 (A "Gelaendewagen"). The "we" feels like work buddies, all male.  I'm sitting in the backseat.  Not sure who is driving.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We're driving on some sort of elevated highway, elevated enough not to see the ground.  Instead of typical lanes in a highway, the "roads" are actually connections between various floating platforms, with these connections jutting out at right angles and humped in the middle, like old bridges over waterways. There are people everywhere, but all heading in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We emerge from the clouds to see what I can only describe as a huge themepark cross lost city looming over us.  The architecture is extremely modern and captivating.  I take out the camera and start taking snaps of the people on the road with this amazing backdrop filling up the lens.  We're in the shadow of the city as we descend towards ground level.  My nose starts bleeding profusely, so I turn the camera on myself and jokingly take pictures. My colleagues are not worried about this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Our 4x4 is now a bakkie of some sorts, and some pedestrians have hopped into the back.  They're speaking Afrikaans, which seems highly irregular in this country filled with Eastern Europeans and Russians.  I can't remember what they were saying, but I told them in Afrikaans not to talk such shit.  They were not surprised that I understood them and could even talk back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;We hop out of the 4x4 and start walking with the other pedestrians.  We're now at the edge of an immense lake, beautifually serene. The clouds are low but they lift up to reveal a beautiful alpine like mountain range, with one specific peak standing heads and shoulders above the range.  "This is where I should go" I tell myself.  There are still tons of people around, the vibe is certainly student like, the crowd is young yet yearning for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After walking around the lake's edge to the right, we're faced with a massive flight of stairs that crest a little hill.  They lead to this place of knowledge, but I can't see it from the base of the stairs.  The stairs are irregular in angle, obviously catering to the contours of the land beneath them.  I get the feeling that those stairs are important, the stairway to enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of americans at the base of these stairs, lounging around, resting on the rocks like fat and tired tourists. It's also here that I see the first sign of ladies.  I hear a lot of whining amongst them, they're here like everyone else, but don't have the energy to climb the stairs.  I remember turning around at this stage and standing on the rocks, looking back at the amazing city and the lake to our left. I also recall bumping into an old friend there before the dream ended.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bakers will always be Bakers&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My life is a bumpy ride over emotional altitude. I'll have periods of raw excitement followed by feeling just plain low.  It's always been that way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot about my makeup, how I was structured. Would things be different for me if I was brought up in a separate environment? Would I learn to love myself if I was encouraged and congratulated through life?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now given a foundation, shaky or not, does that still prevent a building from reaching heights?  Does a building need to reach heights to be impressive? Does a building need to be impressive if it offers exactly what a building should? No. What do you have the capacity to change?  The architecture. It will take time to rebuild but it will be a feat unto itself.  You've got is the soil beneath your foundations, that stupidly insignificant stake of earth. You've also got a team of builders, eager for work, eager for producing quality.  All you've really got is a blank sheet of paper the same size of the inclined draughting board in front of you.  Pick up the pen and draw.  Be radical or be conformist in your design, but just draw.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think part of my lull in attitude of late is related to both the amount of games I've been playing, plus the feeling of self-worth in my work.  Whenever I get heavy into gaming, other avenues of my life become neglected. Friends, maintenance, self-esteem.  Gaming is an escape from all those and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Watched War of the Worlds tonight.  I remember why I hate going to watch movies with the old crowd, I enjoyed the story the movie had to tell, plot holes or not, but to hear it over-analysed in a logical fashion afterwards just killed the romance in the story the movie had to tell. The human drama in this movie appealed to me more than the excellent special effects. We are a sad species. We're so individualistic we'll never be at peace with our neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've got some reading to do. Jayesh picked up a copy of "The Alchemist" for me on my 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday, I've heard so much about the book, I'll probably finish it tonight. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Even ice-cream can go sour&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was sitting on the pavement, legs in the street after another full day at work.  It was 8ish, the sun was setting.  I plugged in my iPod and played some Staind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What transpired for the next 15 minutes was truly surreal.  I felt like I was in one of those scenes in a movie, the wind blew briskly, my face warmed by the light of the setting sun and this song, serenading the emotional uprising inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was nothing more to it, except these overwhelming feelings of both ethereality and sadness.  Not sure if the music itself had any effect in worsening my emotional situation, but it sure went with the rhythym of that moment.  I felt like crying and smiling at the same time.  So I had this blank yet relfective expression on my face.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My lesson had been learnt though, it was good for me.  Walking into any encounter with expectations is really bad, especially when those expectations are not met to the full.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Still I felt terrible about the whole thing, especially about my own feelings.  I was cross with her, but it had no foundation in her actions, rather in my own.  I felt rejected through my own actions.  She wasn't the one turning me down, it was my own expectations slapping me through the face.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This last week in Natick was bad, but it proved to me that popping a question is totally worth the risk.  My time spent with her was considerably better than wasting away behind a computer :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BTW, the song was "Staind - Epiphany".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New beginnings, always exciting :)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I started an entry earlier today but for some reason I left it blank. Now it's time to fill it with some juicy goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of you know me well enough to know I'm a tad too timid to try anything in the female relations department.  Today was different.  Today I popped a casual coffee-date proposal to someone who makes me tickle inside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Picture this, I'm pacing back and forwards in my little hotel room, thinking about how best to approach the situation.  I thought up outrageous plans, except maybe the one about serenading at her window.  The only musical instrument I can play is a rhythym stick. So, I hopped onto MSN for advice from an online bud, the Almighty_1. :D  He didn't help me much, but he pointed me in the agreeable right direction.  After much deliberation I was off with a plan!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Boldly I paced down the stairs, room key and 10 dorra in hand. The plan was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Acquire primary target, codename: "Ice Cream" from Hotel lobby fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Pay for said Ice Cream at the front desk, as is common practice, where our intended lass, code-name: "J" works.  All the while avoiding detection.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Scope for enemy hostiles, and move in to broadcast distance.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Send encoded signal to "J", acquire response and vacate the area before Charlie arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In reality, it went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Successfully picked out an ice-cream flavour from the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Waited in the queue for my chance to pay for the ice cream.  Agent "J" was nowhere to be seen. Area was swarming with enemy hostiles. (I assumed Agent J had been discovered and taken into enemy custody).  Reverted to Plan B.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Left a short message with Agent J's sidekick.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Charlie arrived, so I bolted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;and then...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Agent J contacted me over the wired transceiving antenna.  I play dumb, assuming the enemy could be listening in to our very converation.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;I forgot a frikkin spoon for the ice cream!&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;I tell Agent J I will rendezvous with her at the Lobby, ETA: 1 min.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Agent J points me in the direction of the pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Once again, the area was swarming with hostiles.  I decided not to send the signal.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;I vacated the area and hurried off to the extraction point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I was left with only one option. Phone her. Screw those commie bastards if they listen in, I've got to speak to her, alone! So, I dialled guest services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiing riiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiing riiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiing riiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside: "Oh noes, she's got my room number on her phone terminal!  She's ignoring me!"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside: "Why doesn't she answer!"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*riiiiiiiiiiing riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;*click* I hung up the phone. I try busy myself with opening the ice cream...  then my phone rings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this point when I answer the phone, I bet she could hear me smiling over the phone :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"Coffee?" Her tone curious. "Sure!  How about tomorrow!" She says.  With a "woohoo" inside, I agreed and took down her number.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm typing this out, trying to eat rock-hard ice cream with a smile so wide. The ice cream is OK, but it doens't matter how good or bad it tastes, it's the best damn ice cream I've ever bought!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flying back to my home from home&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was staring out the window of our Canadair RegionalJet on our way back to a stormy Boston, The following happened:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Peering down, the surface cloudy from laden moisture.  The soft cold air coating my nostrils with a freshness.  Below the patch surface. There are lights below. Lights shimmering in the murk below.  If I reach out, I dream I can touch this invisible surface but reason is telling me it is not there.  Still, I sit here, way up here, looking down and imagine ripples in my past.  Ripples distorting this invisible surface.  Ripples bouncing the dying sunlight in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a stressful week at the client's offices in Georgetown, MD.  A logistical pain-in-the-ass. The return car journey to the return flight was to be expected, but we arrived at the airport on turn.  We were greeted with a security search queue that almost went out the terminal doors back into the parking lot. Tensions heightened.  We raced to the gate after being cleared by security only to find out our flight to Boston was to be delayed. For two whole hours. God bless america.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When in Rome...&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I found myself involved in an internal dilemna while travelling from my hotel room to the hotel cafe: "Why can't the entrance to the stairs be closer to the elevator?"&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So much laziness in this country, but is it also efficiency?  It probably takes me less time to scale the stairs to the 3rd (err, fourth) floor than to wait and take the elevator. If the entrane to the stairs was closer to the lobby it would be even faster, but then why am I taking the stairs in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think its to do some exercise rather than being a truly lazy git and taking the elevator. So why am I moaning about having to walk further just to get to the stairs? heh.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;...do as the romans do&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Work is bad here.  The company is a new, red-tape-tied-down beast that could easily rival big brother in clinical extremeity towards its own employees or "resources".  I feel like the red-tape-rogue here, an outsider, free-thinking rebel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is corporate cubicle america.  It is cold, unforgiving and clinical.  I look forward to flying home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day-jah-voo&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of you may recall this blog entry: &lt;a href="http://ndorfin.blogspot.com/2005/01/ive-missed-you-why-dream-i-had-this.html"&gt;dreaming about boston and lost loves&lt;/a&gt;. Well, the weirdest thing happened today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you didn't know already, I'm in Boston as I'm typing this :) This time for 2 weeks on a short business project.  Anyway, from that last link, you'll notice the bit:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I'm here to collect M's great aunt. We arrive in Boston, but the airport doesn't look familiar. Instead, I'm getting a documentary overview of the city, as if I was watching a tourist information clip about the city.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;M's aunt and I are on a weird jerking tram system, it makes all the old ladies on it feel uncomrfortable, yet they know they're safe because they've done it so many times before. M's aunt is rattling off to me, telling me of many things, but I'm not paying attention, maybe even ignoring her. The tram weaves thru strange unknown parts of Boston and at one point all the old women aboard time it perfectly: They throw bread out the tram's open air windows into a lake which is already covered in soggy bread and a multitude of white and patchy geese.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, picture this. I've just spent 21 hours travelling from JHB to BOS, and as I step off the airplane walkway, I'm greeted with a huge photo spread on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The poster is of swans in a pond, below a bridge and a backdrop I distinctly remember from my dream.  I stood there, gobsmacked.  So, I took out the camera and took a snap.  Unfortunately it didn't come out very well :(&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I suspect the photo was there last time we landed in Boston, and I subconciously noted it. Weird how the brain can play back things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Re-tracing steps&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bus trip to the terminal in Framingham brought back both excellent and bad memories alike. Its good to be back here actually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna be in Boston for a few days, then a team of us is heading over to Maryland, VA, for some project scoping.  That should last a week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Its now 5:45PM, I'm waiting for 6PM so I can scoot downstairs and grab something to eat before I die.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Feed the cats for me, and don't forget to switch off the lights before you leave every morning.  I'll be home soon honey, love you lots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gratz to Jay on his 28th. Sorry I missed it. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The calling&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Fog settles over the water.  Obscurity before vision, impairing primary senses.&lt;br /&gt;
    The water is eeringly still, not even wavelets lapping at the sides of the boat.&lt;br /&gt;
    A smell of rotting rests upon the water, it is sickening. As if the water had been stagnant for months, no new life, not even in the byproducts of the cycleless festering.&lt;br /&gt;
    The captain is hesitant, visible unsure of his own actions.  I pity the fool. He's leading us all to our doom.&lt;br /&gt;
    He bends his head, listening intently. That's all we have out here, the sounds and the gut. Noses are clogged with decay, eyes milky with the veil drawn in front of them and nothing but the taste of a dry, parched mouth.&lt;br/&gt;
    What is that fool listening for?  Or, worse, what is he listening to! He's listening like the lives on this fate-weighted vessel depend on his two last remaining senses. Listening, for the call of doom.&lt;br /&gt;
    Why doesn't he just use his gut? Why don't we throw anchor and wait for the fog to rise?  I sense he's been here before, in this same situation.  Maybe this captain is not so much a fool as he is our saviour.&lt;br /&gt;
    I hear it!  Its beautiful!  A voice, like ambrosia, sweetly deadly. Where is it coming from? She loves me!  She loves me alone! Her song makes her dreamingly intriguing, creating images of serenity, untainted splendour.&lt;br /&gt;
    I must find this voice, find the origin of this honey for ears, find the source of this pleasure forthcoming. She is so close, I can almost feel her.  Feel her breath on my neck and in my ear, prickling the hairs on my anticipative skin like a cold, fresh wind.&lt;br /&gt;
    Where is she?  Why does she sing so? She's lonely!  She's hurt!  I must help her.  She's in danger.  I'm coming!  I'll save you!&lt;br /&gt;
    The captain hears her too.  He wants her all to himself. I won't let him.&lt;br /&gt;
    Captain, why do you draw your musket?&lt;br /&gt;
    Put it down, or I'll gut you, you selfish seadog.  She's mine.  She only loves me.&lt;br /&gt;
    Captain, why did you pull the trigger?&lt;br /&gt;
    I'm bleeding, my hand extended before me is warm from the blood running down my arm.&lt;br /&gt;
    Before it fades to black, I realise that the fog has lifted, revealing our collective doom.&lt;br /&gt;
    Our captain, you saved me from a guilt ridden hell, but you have cursed yourself by taking my life. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
    The light fades, eyelid's close.  I smile as I realise I can hear the wavelets caressing the soft belly of our boat once again.  Such a soothing sound it is. I could fall asleep to this rhythym. Sleep and dream, and never wake.
   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cruising at thirty-five thousand&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So I got a chance to type a bit, everytime I fly to Cape Town I think of one particular night on a lengthy bus trip to the Cape, overnight.  The bus was cruising along, a new bus, smoothly.  The sun had set as we left the bus terminal in Johannesburg, we were now just past Kimberley.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The moon was out in its full glory, lighting up the karoo with an eerie glow, like there was a huge filter over the sun, or wearing 4 pairs of sunglasses at the same time.  Picture it, the shrubbery whizzing by, just outside the bus, my head in the openness of the window and the wide panoramic view it afforded.  That moonlight squashed all the stars out the night sky it was so intense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, why I am I heading down to Cape Town?  Well, the primary reason is to attend one of South Africa's first Web Standards related conferences or forums. The tied first would have to be to see Mom and Patrick :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Work hasn't been going well.  There are so many ideals and dreams not realised at the office.  It's just a routine again, something I detested when I worked at Dimension Data.  Maybe I need a change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of me is thinking I need to just get out of here.  To run away and do something totally offbeat.  One of the ideas was to help out in some volunteer organisation, you know, do something like help a biological research team in deepest darkest africa, or visit a foreign country, learn a foreign language and be a foreigner for a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But then I am reminded of the typical thinking, Buy a house, marry, have kids, raise them to do the same.  That sounds so, erm, typical.  I keep thinking, why is it neccesary to make money?  Maybe thats the reason for wanting to disappear, is to understand that money is not everything.  I want to wake early in the mornings, work for my food and lodging and enjoy doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Radical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bluesy Betty was an enormous woman. She was that graceful yet extremely lazy elephant of a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Every Monday, Wednesday and especially Fridays she had a gig at the corner Blue Foundation Cafe in down-town Chicago.  Life for Betty on the outside was a glorious affair one of soulful rhythyms, huge smiles and glorious tones.  Inside, she was unhappy, a hopeless dreamer singing her lonely call three times a week.  This inner beauty shone through when she sang, it had meaning, loaded with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Slim-Joe and Earl, two ungainly characters were Betty's entourage.  One a double-bass plucker, the other, a keyboard dabbling monkey, both hell bent on finding that perfect vibe to bring out Betty's soul, that soul that kept the crowds coming back, session after session.  There were always the fascinated regulars at the cafe, but for the most part the cafe earned its exceptional revenue from over-priced bourbons served to the dollar swinging tourists. 3 times a week, Betty sang her lonely song to herself, and like a caged bird the onlookers came to see her and feel her call within themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Everyone is lonely" Betty would say to her boys. "You've gotta sing to that lonely person inside" She would say...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I'm so going to hell...&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recently did some test which revealed that I'm really going to enjoy my stay in hell. 7th plane of hell or some such. Bring it on!  I think the test, being all christian based, obviously gives you a "crap" score if you're not a "believer".  So much for moral guidelines, more like moral guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That's probably related to the genocide I perform on a daily basis here in the office.  See, I am the evil ant-slayer.  The little bastards decided to infest our offices here at the Campus. As a result, my fingers actually smell of formic acid from all the mutilated ant corpses I leave in my trail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It got me thinking though...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We're suffering heavy losses on the table-top front madam.  Casualties exceed 1% of our total combined forces.  Reports are flying in from our fly-on-the-wall scouts, reports of massive carnage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duly noted number 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you have us do your highness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call that useless husband of mine, plus the fertility expert.  We've got some work to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving to TAC-CON ALPHA at your signal ma'am. Number 1 out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And in a separate but somewhat related vein, I saw the following advert attached to a stop sign on my drive home on Friday...  &lt;cite&gt;BEES REMOVED, CALL ANT (08x xxx xxxx)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Passion vs. Profit&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recently I've had a few conversations with some kewl people about "Passion vs. profit". If you started a job on your own, or a project, do you do it for passion or for profit?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I'm convinced that passion orientated work is much richer or higher quality than profit related work.  Take art as an example. While I'm no art "fundi", I'm sure that most of the best art-works ever produced were done out of passion, not profit.  Art sours when its done with profit in mind. The promise or hope of extra pennies-in-the-pocket somehow has a detrimental effect on the quality of your output.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I found that recently with my work in Web Standards. Some of the best work I've produced has been out of the "hobby" fascination with the industry.  Not because I got paid to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How about the rest of you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One particular conversation got me to punch out this blog entry, on the topic of Medical Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel "robbed" by insurance and medical aid companies? I'm talking to those that are healthy and haven't had an accident recently. I can't help but think that if I put all that cash I'm spending on inusrance and medical aid into a savings account, not only would I see the benefits of saving my own money, but potentially save enough money to help me when / if I'm involved in an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It got me thinking, what service does an insurance company really offer then?  I pay them each month for the potential risk I might one day face. For that, they take my money and spend it on those people who have accidents here and now. Why should I pay excess if I'm involved in an accident? Why do I get stoic-toned letters in the mail telling me my monthly charges are going up?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It's all about the mullah.  How sad is that?  Where are the paladin's of world industry? The ones who help because they can, not because they want your gratitude.  The nameless heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surely, if you put service (or passion) for your work first, profit will come later? Or will the profit-seeking-individuals you serve take you for a ride instead? Material attachment is a curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take my hand you say&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bare feet step silently towards me, your long dress gently moving with your graceful strides.  You reach your hand out to me, palm up, a gesture of guidance. You've got this confident smile on your face, something reassuring starts to build up inside me as I get up.  You're amazing to me.  We walk down the stairs off the porch, hand in hand.  You turn your head back to smile again, a moment etched in my mind forever.  That smile, so seductive, so personal.  I'm battling to keep up as you break out into a sprint.  I feel clumsy, but I'm still having fun. You're laughing now, it's contagious.  With all our clothes on, you pull me into the water, I'm careless now. In these pleasant waters you told me, and I was breath-taken. Drowned in the waters of your emotion.  Where we're going, we don't need air to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Funny things happen to funny people&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On saturday night, I met a girl I was destined to meet at some point. It was arranged, so to say.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I didn't get many opportunities (or rather, I didn't MAKE many opportunities) to chat to her, but when I did, I enjoyed her company, her friendly outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The night danced on and she was flirting with everyone, including me.  I liked her.  Butterflies et al.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I struck up a conversation with our mutual friend, expressing my interest in this girl to which I got the following response: &lt;cite&gt;Shaun, she's not the long-term-relationship-kinda-girl, she's more of a party girl, so if you want her, she's more than available.&lt;/cite&gt;.  My jaw dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A huge steel door dropped from the ceiling of the narrow vaulted passageway between us.  My interest sagged like a walk-the-plank type plank with a fat pirate on the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So it got me thinking today, why?  Why the sudden loss of interest after hearing she was the one-night-stand-type?  And as a close friend pointed out: Why write her off based on someone else's statement?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It made me think of past relationships, it made me think of trust.  Could I trust a girl who has such a reputation?  It made me think of love vs. lust. Do I want to be seen as another bomb icon on the hood of her tight air-frame? Do I want to come across as a guy who's just out to shag?  No! I want the whole deal, Serious Sam I am.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;FFS, why does life, love and maybe even lust have to be so complicated for me.  Anyway, clear points arose: Don't be so quick to judge, Listen to uncle Jay when he says: Don't believe everything you hear or read if it doesn't agree with your own common sense, and of course: Lighten the fuck up and find out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The ground you're walking on is not really there.&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Met 2 new interesting people today.  Had a chat, well, tried, lets just say TV got in the way.  I'm so boring to chat to, that other people would rather watch TV than listen to me waffle on about bread and pumpkins. :(&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In other news, its time for the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My bad brain&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The binary thinker, on and off, black and white.  No inbetween.  Hardline: like being shot for raising a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Had a great waffle, coffee and chat with "the wisest man I know" again.  So sporadic are our meetings, its like we've got the world to talk about, all pent up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We talked about past experiences, mistakes, judgements and just plain-old-human-nature.  I think I mentioned it a while back that I operate in a very black and white way, its either for or against stance.  Seems thats gotten me into trouble, burnt a few bridges too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How does one shift a mindset, or a predisposed way of thinking into a new state?  How can one unlearn something as intimate as your own thought processes? I meam to, but its gonna take time.  And patience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was thinking the other day about the perception of time. A fly always manages to escape your slap, no matter how fast you move your hard, no matter how hellbent you are into seeing fly-splatter on the inside of your palm.  They seem to have lightning quick reactions.  Now, is it because their nervous systems are engineered for quick response (like a reports driven datasbase is architected to give speedy results), what if the Fly sees life a lot slower?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How many of you think your weeks are flying by faster than they used to?  Is that because the neural pathways are getting pot-hole ridden?  Our perception of time is worsening?  Or its just another monday to sunday?  I'm sure routine fits in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What if martial arts training (or any other quick reaction sport / game) is also training in slowing down ones perception of time? Is bullet-time even perceivable within ones existence?  I'd like to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Had a great round of mashie golf with my colleagues today.  I love that buzz you get from hitting a ball with the perfect strike, it goes exactly where you intended.  That's what keeps you coming back to the golf course. Sometimes I see that in life.  Little idiosyncracies (sp?) that let you know you're human.  Laughter, a smile from a stranger, being complimented, feeling appreciated, falling in love. I live for that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;You look more delectable tonight than ever before.  Hair neatly tied back with one strand of your rich brown hair danlged over the left side of your face, angling down to your sultry mouth.  Eyes half closed, cute little nose (Maxi Jazz says it best).  Fire behind your eyes, burning for me. Your healthy skin from your exposed shoulder seems to glow, all the way up to the base of your ear, your neck surely defines the best lines ever conceived.  You're exuding confidence tonight, professional, the queen amongst the drones, a wave along a beach teasing the sand in your wake. You move through the people with a flare, I can read your inner passion. I smile, knowing that you can read mine too. You are mine and I am yours. I want to be selfish, I want you all to myself, but such beauty caged is criminal.  You are that drifting-on-the-air bee-eater, perched on my hand.  I want to take pictures, but there is no need. You'll always be in my mind, so vividly fetching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tonight, unlike any other night&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
   Tonight is now, so different, so unique. I'm here now, thinking about tonight. Thoughts coursing, each on its own voyage, its own destination. Thinking I can dance among the stars with the moon.  It shines so bright.
   A voyage applicable to a date, defined by the moment, time-stamped with an identifier. Moments captured, held down like a wild animal, the want, the need to escape. To escape and to be free, to roam, to be free.  Free at last, free for now.
   Wind running through your hair, tickling your essence like a playful child with a smile, a smile that makes you wish you were that child, an inferno, burning inside, a baseless passion for life, interest, seeing fun in learning the ropes of life, not knowing all the pain, the evil. Only good.  Uncorrupted. Innocence is beautiful.
   Innocence is candy, sweet, live-for-the-moment, but ultimately bad for you.  Cancer tablets, but they taste so good. Engineered to taste good, engineered to suit you.  Pop your pills, instinctual.
   Numbers and letters, useless without construct. Useless without a plan, and plan to succeed. Succeed where others have failed because you have planned. Suceed because you breed it, offspring flourish in your sun-shadow. You're a point of reference, Your name is Chloro Phil. You're a catalyst. Water to a seed, medium for its roots, the sun that gives life. Encouraging, always smiling, the provider. I am just a plant, I rely on you and your friends. I am your slave, Je suis a toi. Reliant, yet a provider in my own right. You would be my parent and I would have my own children. A cycle of life. Even when I die there is growth. A legacy, maybe even a legend.  Hopefully not a myth. Record me, I'm glowing.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Turning the corner&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last weekend, a few mates and I went to the old high school to smack the cricket ball around a bit.  I ended up with a still-sore-and-bruised big toe after receiving a full pitched ball on the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While my toe is still-sore-and-bruised, there was something else about that saturday morning that got me thinking about South Africa as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The primary cricket pitch was occupied by the First Team, and its saturday competitor. The away team was fielding first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We glanced with interest from the nets everytime the sound of willow resounded through the grounds.  Our home team was showing who was boos. Pride sweltered like the hot highveld air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Life at and after school wasn't always about pride. This was the same high school that was marred with editorials and main-stream news articles about its racial intolerance.  I recall going to school on days where you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. Heck, I jumped on the bandwagon too.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We carried on playing in the nets, feeling like old men trying to bowl a ball like we used to.  In the nets alongside us, the first team captain or coach was pitching a few balls to the next batsmen, a black student.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It wasn't long before a wicket fell and the next-in-line batsman waddled up to the pitch.  At the crease were two black students now, something I never saw in my 5 years at high school.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That same tension I felt at school, I could feel again, even from the sidelines of the pitch.  The away team taunted the batsmen with overly zealous and out-of-line "HOWZZAAAAAAAAATT!"'s ringing out, ball after ball from the fielders.  The batsmen were visibly uneasy at their creases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We went on with our own smacktalk in our nets, laughing at our own batsman who probably hadn't batted in about 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sound of willow continued to pour out from the pitch, much to the delight of the home team cheering on their batsmen from the clubhouse. That sense of pride came over me again for my old high school. I smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the purpose of this entry was mostly about hope in SA.  Every year students and pupils get better integrated.  In a few generations or less, we'll see a remarkably different South Africa, guided by its children (who as we all know, know better.) :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While this is a simple story about a weekend's worth of cricket anecdotes laden with heavy and potentially flame-baiting messages, I'd like to re-inforce that I hope you see it the same way I see it: "Things are improving".&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Getting &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;order&amp;gt;&amp;lt;mylife /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/order&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;2-3 hours more than normal: the time it took for me to actually doze off last night fighting the effects of a stoned cold fever. All my joints were aching, I was cold, felt stoned as everything was taking way too long. Shivering. Yet I hadn't done anything dubious. :/&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This morning I dreaded going into work, something that's been developing this year like a malignant growth on my enthusiasm gland. Partly because I had a review session with one of my managers.  I was also feeling guilty about having to deal with my irresponsiblity around thursday's drinking debauchery and the subsequent friday truancy due to excessive hang-over symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The review session started off really bad. (Let's just state 2005 has not been a good year so far, in terms of my work ethic.) I took it in my stride, sucked it up, I deserved to be told off. Once that was out the way, the next 30 minutes were as they always are with our Business Development Manager: Inspiring.  I left the session with a head full of responsibilites and a renewed passion for my work. 2005 looks to be improving.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;That said, time to get my own life in order.  No more pissing around - I've got a career to build!  As for the personal side of things, that comes second.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Upgrade time?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've been mulling over a much needed PC upgrade.  R6000ish for a new PC, maybe a nice LCD monitor too.  This laptop is great, but its also a work laptop.  Getting a PCI-E chipset is just ridiculous in terms of cost, I can't justify spending an extra 4 grand just to get a PCI-E Gfx card.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;First, a decent table and office chair for the home-office-corner is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;All these ideas, and no scrapbooks.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've gotta start getting things done. I've got a ton of ideas with regard to work, my hobbies and persoanl issues.  Now I just need to turn them into realities.  One such idea was having a blog, with a photo per entry, call it: "Mental Images".  Then having a list of thoughts around the photo.  A good example was something I saw the other day in the office...&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We have a partner company that pretty much sells nothing, it is a fledgling company with a great idea and no implementation.  They have all the flashiest marketing and awesome office decor.  Anyway, they had a whole host of coffee mugs embossed with their logos, nice looking mugs.  We happened to acquire one within our office, which we use as the dirty spoon cup for all our coffee needs.  The handle is broken on this mug.  I thought: "Hey, that's a metaphor for the company itself!  It might hold water, but its not very useful.".  Of course, this idea would have to be incorporated in my own site, running on my own box at an ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Plucking Petals.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Housekeeping!" Came the knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Housekeeeeeping!!!" The mandatory second knock, followed by the practiced opening of the hotel door with the master key-card.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Betty was your average Hotel Worker, mid to late 30's, a passion for cigarettes and a distinct distaste for her job. Today was going to be another notch in her totem pole of hotel work oddities.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Picking up clothes in the entrance area, Betty got on with her routine as she typically did, a thousand times over. There was a damp smell on air inside the penthouse room, the aircon's probably need some regassing again.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Royal Beagle Hotel, your average hotel (with all those appealing extras like Chocolates-on-your-pillows) was situated in downtown Manhattan.  Prices were good for such a neighbourhood, so the clientele was volumnous and recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Hmm, this is the second time this week I'm picking up flower vases again, what is with these people!" Betty muttered to herself as she brushed all the pottery pieces into her hungry and awaiting tray. The flowers lay lifeless, still pretty, but with no glow.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Betty made her way to the master bedroom, a place she used countless times as the basis for wealthy marriage to that someone special. The double arch doors were almost latched closed, a sliver of light separating the two in half. Betty put her weight into the door but hit her right arm and shoulder against the now stuck door.  With a hefty push, the door flung open.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Nerves went cold and useless. Muscles relaxed in Betty's left hand, releasing the air freshener can and the cleaning cloth.  The can rattled off the marble floor with a sound that startled its former owner.  Betty let out the scream like her own life depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Over-reaction = Meltdown&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;At school, I did my best to avoid any sort of bullying. I felt sick to my stomach each time I was belittled.  I dreaded people talking about me behind my back, sometimes even catching people talking about me without them knowing I was within audible distance.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Kids.  Evil things.  I resorted to ignoring, or playing aloof.  I was a fool.  I still am a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I have a big problem with not knowing my enemy, my foe must have a face and name.  So it can be personal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got a rude, spoofed SMS the other day.  Something very personal.  Something that attacked me.  And I didn't know who sent it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I had a hint of who it could have been, but I needed proof before laying baseless accusations and upsetting someone else. So I phoned MTN's customer services to find out if they could trace the SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Turns out they don't have the means to do such things.  Plan B: Survey suspicions - Jackpot! What was intended as a practical joke was now blown horribly out of proportions. I was livid.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What really irked me was finding out who delivered the message. Someone I know and trust and don't expect such things from. Someone who in my mind has always been fair and humble.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It puts a lot of things into perspective for me.  Nasty things too.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;I know a supposed-porn star!&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I can rest well, knowing that I once met a supposed real-life porn star. Someone who's family I know too.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;My mom and her dad got on real well, he was a bit of a selfish tool, but he was good for my mom. He was one of those supposed parents that thought distraction and money are good ways of getting your kids out of your hair.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Staind - Open your eyes&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				[...]&lt;br /&gt;
				A boy just 13 on the corner for sale&lt;br /&gt;
				Swallows his pride for another hit&lt;br /&gt;
				Overpopulation there's no room in jail&lt;br /&gt;
				But most of you don't give a shit&lt;br /&gt;
				That your daughters are porno stars&lt;br /&gt;
				and Your sons sell death to kids&lt;br /&gt;
				You're so lost in your little worlds&lt;br /&gt;
				Your little worlds you'll never fix&lt;br /&gt;
				[...]
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this "porn star" chick now lives in the same complex as me. She's a real poppie too. No emotion. No morals. Just a shagging-for-a-living-shit-for-brains-sheep.  She is filth, and she's not even hot.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"What do you do Ms. Angel Jugs?" Enquired the reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"I am a masseur." said the make-up over-indulged bimbo.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Oh, that's lovely. What do you charge your clients?" The reported smirked.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Normal massage: fifty rond. Happy ending: one hundred and fifty rond." she replied in her hollow virgin way.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Jealousy. But Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm jealous, because you promise me things, that you now give to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm cross, beacuse you need to hide things from me, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;You are that filth, you don't know love, because you confuse it with lust. You spread your sickness like your legs, the men love it. I loved it once. I feel dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I would cleanse myself if it would help you, but you're too ignorant for that.  Go and be what you want to be, but don't preach about the right when you only do wrong and all his brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Roasteh Meh&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Sheesh but this week has been quick.  Yesterday I did the skating-in-the-basement thing again.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Why is it that when one shows off, you make a fool of yourself too :D  Picture it, I've just got the cornering-overstep technique creamed, I'm cruising thru the basement like a PMS'ed woman (No offense girls :D) yet smiling at the late-night cleaning staff as I'm going thru the swinging motions.  4 paces later and suddenly the centre of gravity had shifted 10 meters in front of me.  I was flying to the ground :D  Landed on my thighs and elbows and got a nice filthy roasty on my right elbow.  Yay! :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Work has been kinda interesting.  I've been training Zahir in the skills he'll need as a UI goon, he's attentive and thorough, oh, and nervous :D  Got home and then schooled Nitr0s in teh_art.  That night I couldn't sleep cos I was thinking too much about semantic HTML. :/&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;No update on the Porra-Saga.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Film at 7.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Watching the world whirl by...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Friday, such a long time ago, I purchased a new pair of entry-level fitness skates (inline skates or rollerblades). I forgot to get the body to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After trying out my brother's pair down in Cape Town, under the moonlight for many a night, I decided to get my own.  I haven't laughed at myself in such a long time, slipping and sliding, often followed by falling on my arse or hands. Imagine a giraffe, ungainly, never trusting its own legs.  Now give that giraffe two pairs of skates and push it down a hill. Heh, I must look like that.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This morning I packed my gear into the car and headed into work as usual.  Then earlier this evening when most of the nerds had left, I whipped out the skates and proceeded to further my exploration in the field of balance and rhythym.  iPod playing, smooth-as-a-baby's-backside-concrete-basement-floor whizzing underneath my fresh skates and not so fresh limbs.  There is something to be said about the difference in skating when you're listening to hard-rock (like: A - Nothing) or some cheesy dramatic song (like: Air - Alone in Kyoto). Anyway, had fun burning it up and evading the staring lab-rats.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Feeling more confident about the skating, just the braking needs some work before I try new techniques :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Rejection, in all its forms.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Hmm, bravery or stupidity makes me declare that I tried my hand at an online dating service. Heh. "Shaun, what would your mother say!".  So yeah, I experimented. Contacted someone who's profile looked interesting, she's now hidden her profile.  Then I contacted someone who's quite prominennt in the online scene.  She's now modified her bio to say: "Please don't be mad if I don't reply..." and now accepts members of the same sex as potential dates. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ladder Theory?  Online?!? o.O  Oh well, the experiement hasn't ended.  I keep saying: "Hey, at least I don't fake that I'm christian to pick up chicks at Youth" like someone I know. One thing is true, I must look like a mad-humping-rabbit-type, just wanting to go down in the burrow with each and every furry-bun-bum I lay eyes on. I blame other men for that.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;In unrelated news...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Manic Street Preachers have an old song called: Tsunami.  Quite haunting, especially with the indo-asian instruments playing in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				For you my dear sister&lt;br /&gt;
				Holding onto me forever&lt;br /&gt;
				Disco dancing with the rapists&lt;br /&gt;
				Your only crime is silence
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Can't work at this anymore&lt;br /&gt;
				Can't move I want to stay at home&lt;br /&gt;
				Tied up to all these crutches&lt;br /&gt;
				Never far from your hands
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Can't speak, can't think, won't talk, won't walk
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Doctors tell me that I'm cynical&lt;br /&gt;
				I tell them that it must be chemical&lt;br /&gt;
				So what am I doing girl&lt;br /&gt;
				Cry into my drink I disappear
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Eyes for teeth waving over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Bring down the shadows of my mind&lt;br /&gt;
				Sleep and breathe under our sheets&lt;br /&gt;
				Inhale the anxiety in-between, in-between, in-between, in-between
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Through September under the weather
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				In-between, in-between, in-between, in-between
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Tsunami tsunami came washing over me&lt;br /&gt;
				Take the G.I's, I will have the spies
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;On the northern front...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Come end of Feb, if things go the right way, I'll be winging my way to Lisbon, Portugal. I'm already considering learning a tad porra :D  Portugal is one of those places that I know nothing of, except for the fact that its almost slipping off the European continent or is regarded as the lost province of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Really looking forward to all the challenges it will present.  A language barrier, travelling on my own, and best of all, getting some solid work done with total strangers.  Can't wait to see what life is like there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I was bold, almost foolish.  I had a new toy and I was ready to show it off to anyone who would see it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Hand outstretched, into the darkness. My mind illuminating the way, the way before my fingertips. Moving still, till the elbow clicked in its socket.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Waving my fingers like live bait in the fish infested waters, teasing for a bite. A passer by, an ignoramus.  A full-stomach one, and a confused one. Stupid little fish.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A BITE! I've got one! REEL IT IN, QUICK!&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The line lay limp like a lifeless leech. Damnit.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Earl leaned over from the other side of the boat: "Shaun, you've got to make them little slippery buggers think they've won.  If they feel they've lost, they'll not spend another ounce of energy!"&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"I don't want the sissys goddamnit!  I want the fighters! I want the greedy ones!" I snapped back at Earl like a barracuda.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Earl turned around and carried on whistling to the water, always the same tune.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, Earl and I sipped on Bourbon while the moon danced above our camp fire.  Earl landed a big one that day, I went to sleep with a full belly and a mind unsettled by new experiences.  Now if only these crickets could learn to sleep too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;I've missed you, why?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A dream I had this morning...&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I don't know where I am.  It feels like South Afirca.  I see warnings, warnings of great pain towards me and my old love interest, M.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;M is the star of her own SA made TV series, and now it feels like the episode has started, with me. I haven't seen M for ages. The warnings in the beginning were like a teaser for the episode. I see many of the teaser bites later on, specifically the dungeon, embraced in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I'm here to collect M's great aunt. We arrive in Boston, but the airport doesn't look familiar.  Instead, I'm getting a documentary overview of the city, as if I was watching a tourist information clip about the city.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;M's aunt and I are on a weird jerking tram system, it makes all the old ladies on it feel uncomrfortable, yet they know they're safe because they've done it so many times before.  M's aunt is rattling off to me, telling me of many things, but I'm not paying attention, maybe even ignoring her. The tram weaves thru strange unknown parts of Boston and at one point all the old women aboard time it perfectly: They throw bread out the tram's open air windows into a lake which is already covered in soggy bread and a multitude of white and patchy geese.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We move on, and soon I am seperated from the old ladies. My tram takes me towards a more rural side of "Boston", another familiar place but not visually familiar at all.  I'm skipping along the main street, high above the houses, hopping over the roofs. Then I see her.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Her back is to me as she's working in the vegetable garden at side of what can only be called a hut. Its a regular rectangular shaped thing with a flat roof.  I descend from the air in my last leap and land next to her without making a noise.  I embrace her and kiss her lightly on the neck.  She's missed me.  She looks different, more nautral, I can't decide for better or worse, but I still love her.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;She's worried about the state of health of her aunt, yet greatly relieved to see me. I feel so at home with my head in her neck, watching her smile, hearing her voice, caressing her.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;After a few more close moments, we head into town.  We're headed to a dungeon of sorts.  When we arrive, we're walking around the central complex, above a pit or moat of some sort, where inside, there are vast screens of numbers, all laser projected and counting down or up.  47, 54 or 57 the one said. Its mad, this place looks like an asylum, or jail.  In the towering inner complex, I can make out faces of people behind terminals, who I can only classify as agents. They're studying numbers or inteliigence.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We walk round the outer complex some more, when the ramp up to M's aunt's room on the ground floor is number free. (the projected numbers are like laser beams, motion detectors.) Inside her open air room is M's aunt and 2 other people. One, a great old female friend whole loves M's aunt very much and the other is a doctor type who I can also assume is female.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;M at this stage is very distrrught. She doesn't want to be here, but we take up two seats anyway. I'm not touching M. M's aunt is sitting in the corner between her old friend and the doctor. Her friend has her arm on her lap, consoling her. M's aunt is looking very bad at this stage, totally different to how I saw her on the tram. No hair, in hospital robes and very weathered. She's lapsing in and out of conciousness. My focus is on M, when her aunt starts speaking: "I just saw his hand and pen disappear" I look down and sure enough, I'm waving a long pen around in front of me, with my elbows on my knees, leaning forward. M starts to cry.  I look at M's aunt from M's perspective and all I'm thinking is: "Go easy old lady, move on, pass on without pain!"&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I don't know if M's aunt passed or not, but some voice explained to me that when M's aunt said she couldn't see the pen in my hands, that part of my essence had flown into her at that moment, and I was weakened by it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I want to see M again. I want her to love me too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;The journey we all take&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I was just cresting the hill when I eased off the jetpacks, I could feel the heat thru the power armor cladded to my back.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;There he was, taunting me on the horizon, again.  He was nimble and I was struggling to keep up.  With a deep breath I descended down the hill towards my target, gaining speed as my anti-grav insulator did its work.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the hill I was doing close to 150km/h when I instinctively braced for the kick-up-the-arse in the form the jetblast as I hammered the throttle.  Alitmeter rose, I armed my fusor as I saw the horizon again, no sight of that stinky derm.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Radar revealed nothing, comms were dead quiet, but I knew that derm had to be around here somewhere, I could feel the hairs on my back tingle as I realised he was right behind me, hiding in a nook of the summit. I was trapped!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Slowly I turned around, until I got a full view of the derm, standing alert.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Put down your fusor newblood! That won't help you here!"&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"You are quick and sneaky for a derm" I retorted as I threw the Stormhammer to the ground in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;His lips bared teeth, "You still have much to learn my sardine-tin-friend, you're skilled, but skill won't save you here - You need honour!&lt;br /&gt;There is more to this existence than kill-or-be-killed. There is wisdom amongst the older warriors, something you will share one day."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I felt like I had my pants around my ankles, yet enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I can still remember his voice to this day: patient, precise and well practiced.  I have not seen this derm for ages, but I know he's teaching the old code somewhere out there. I have much respect for him, the one they call XPENDABLE!&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;While perusing some of the gited and not so gifted content of &lt;a href="http://www.deviantart.com" title="Browse.to: Deviant Art.com"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; I happened upon the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.fredrikodman.com/" title="Close your eyes kids!"&gt;http://www.fredrikodman.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've always found this sort of imagery powerful, mysterious and downright disturbing. Ogrish fan? Not quite.  This is art!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Most Tool Music videos, including Schism, Sober.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;The Cube (If you haven't seen this movie, please do)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;The Cell, for a Jennifer Lopez film, this was pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Your-typical-Millennium-episode.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Apparently Fredrik takes live snaps of his models (pictures people) and then post processes them (pictures not people).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Empty Entry&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Dear Forgotten Diary,&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I write to you, in a tone I'd rather not use. See, it's been a while, and I've been missing you, but at the same time, I hate you.  I hate what you've made me.  I love you, I'll kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm stuck, halfway between the crack and zen. Sharp tendrils, cut into my skin and attached to the bone, anchor me down.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I bumped into one of your friends the other day.  What a confused soul it is.  It is the type that thinks you can get something without working for it.  It is the type that preaches one thing, but plays another. I saw right thru it.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Been feeling quite dispondent since I've returned to SA. I had so many expectations, expectations that were maybe too high.  I'm stuck in the same trap, when will I learn my lessions? *sigh* I've set myself goals that I knew were unreachable, and now disappointed with my results.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In other news, work is going well.  I was offered a promotion.  The work content has been bad, but because its so clinical and distant. I want to spill the guts with my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to my holiday in Cape Town. Looking forward to escaping all these drugs. Looking forward to looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thats it for now. Please stop those feelings you create within me.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Shaun&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I see goldfish eyes, squiting back at me, obliviously.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I see sadness in their eyes, and in others I see blue steel bravado.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Red eyes, staring backwards, red eyes in the back of their heads. Little white noses, vicious and scarred underbites.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Somehow there's always a cancer stick or two, protuding below the top lip. Spewing sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Faces in the night, some with huge foreheads, always retreating. I wonder what's inside, what drives them, how the face must feel for its mind.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Human likeness in all we see.  Seeing humans in the likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I see you in the streets, but you don't see me.  You're on the prowl and I'm on the stalk, a wooded stalk. You're so in tune with your surroundings yet I can see you amongst all those stripes.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I like the way you're fashionable, yet I have bitter taste for your wanted fashionability. You're so sick, sick with greed, sick with envy, your vision milky from trying to see your objective, your mind misty from thoughts of capture.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Why do you love yourself so much?  Why do you walk past me and not bat a pretty lash? Why do you portray this aura of confidence if your mind is infested with insecurity.  Its eating you from the inside, so thank your convenient god for masks of make-up.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You're so lonely, because you chose your friends like expensive couture.  Fashions change, designers die from drug overdoses, your closet full of clothes has moths.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;On any given night, when the union of undead are out, you pack your companions and pull smiles, the edge of your lips taught from the puppeteering strings that bind you.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Touting the booze, you're so cheap. Intoxicated with your own identity, the same identity on the bodies of your brethren. Anything outside of your cirlce of riveted robots is dirty, look inside you and know that you're filthy too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Come find me, I'm waiting&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All in my head, my vessel of notes, a bobbing bottle of scribbled letters, rolled.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Currents flow, the same way they have for years.  Caught in the sun, fading the glass and weathering the cork jammed up top.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Currents lead, guiding the bottle to its beach. A cushioned landing on soft white powders of shell, embedded in the dissipating bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The sun, leaning towards the sea, beckons you with its orange gestures, like a moth towards the light you are powerless yet completely intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The powders recede beneath your feet, diverted by your momentum. In the corner of your eye, you catch a hint of pale green glinting in the sun.  A bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the cork pops with minimal effort and the rolls of paper slide out, parched from the greenhouse its called home for the past few months. The handwriting is distinguishable and flows, flows as easily as you read it.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Your body arches, toes point to the earth as you embrace yourself and the letter.  Your long angelic hair and matching dress spiral as you ascend, fixated. Outstretched arms like a figure skater, without the friction.  Flying. I'm free, falling to the waiting waters while you're caught up in the lofted moment.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A wave crashes below and I float for a few, before the ink over my body dilutes and smudges.  I am dirty.  I am worthless.  And its all your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Cognac and mixed new experiences, neat.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to have a guided tour through the avenues of mentorship, cognac and sushi last night.  A friend from the office became a good friend in the space of 4 hours. 4 hours I spend contemplating for much longer than 4 hours :)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It all started with good quality red wine (well it tasted good at any rate) and sushi.  A much better experience in sushi than my first. While she was teaching me the finer art of japanese cuisine, she was also imparting much knowledge. Here's a gal I knew very little of and ended up sharing a great evening with.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After watching the wine disappear and mulling over the taste of sushi, we decided to head through to another restaurant that featured a lounge with a live jazz trio. Sipping on Mojitos, and a Mangarita later, idly chatting openly about such things as our make up (no, not make-up) the evening was almost over.  Well, my guide through these new experiences wasn't going to let me go to sleep without sharing the Cognac Experience&amp;trade; with me. She's a very talented photographer, so we went over a few of her pieces and savoured (and sometimes choked :D) on the Cognac. I was learning how to be cultured! Mom would be proud :)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This morning, the drowsiness of the hangover was soon superceded by the graceful thoughts of reliving such a pleasant evening. An experience I wish to repeat when the opportunity arises again.  Reach out people. Try new things.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;nnnDorfin - a net novel&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A while ago I created a new blog template on blogspot.  I've been mulling over a few novel ideas, and secured 3 so far. I'm gonna give the NaNoWriMo a go, just for the hell of it.  Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The first idea is based on my passion for central american culture.  More specifically the advent of Quetzalcoatl in Mayan / Toltec culture. (JFGI).  It will require a lot more research than I hoped, but it'll be good for me.  The second, a psychological drama of a young man and his adventures through paradise.  And lastly, but certainly the most cheesy, a solider story with a twist(ed pair). Maybe my NaNoWriMo could be the three short stories together.  We'll see.  30 000 words is an achievement on its own, something I haven't reached through all this blogging yet (well, what little I have written :D).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Another weekend - to be spent&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Tonight we're heading off to Worcester (the one in MA, not SA :D) to do some ice skating, then tomorrow its Mandy's birthday. We're gonna go check out the Musuem of Fine Arts, followed by some shopping and then hooking up with buddies at the Hard Rock Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;My CD's arrived today.  I got 7 CD's for $100, R100 a CD in my opinion is not bad!  These include:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Adema - Adema (Thought: What the hell!)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Dave Matthews Band - Crash (Really enjoying his stuff, so I splashed out on his classics)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Filter - Title of record (Looking forward to this one)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Groove Armada - Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) (Just cos its kewl)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;KoRn - Greatest Hits (Word up!)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Madonna - Ray of light (Bought this for my mom when it came out, been missing it like I miss my mom :/&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;St. Germain - Tourist (My theme songs for my experiences over here)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing all my friends and family when I return to SA on the 13th. Can't wait!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Two interesting mind-scabs.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Itchy mind-scab 1: Festering.&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;There's this one guy at the office, who I can only describe as a passionate listener, nay, a listening fetishist.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I have mental images of this guy wanting to step up and crawl inside your mouth, peering inside to see what your brain has to reveal. When you talk to him, he has this little smirk on his face, likes hes totally dependent on your every word, like a bloodthirsty paparazzi type journalist finding a scoop on the hottest celeb, well almost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I can just picture his tail wagging and him tilting his head everytime you say: Spot wants to catch the ball!  Oh well, when he talks, the effect is lost (as they say). Its all conspiracy this, and screw the corporation that. Still, an interesting oke.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mind-scab 2: Almost healed.&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the unfortunate experience in using UPS. A package was to be delivered to my door at the hotel, but instead I got a little postcard which said something like: "We were unable to deliver to your address because the address seemed incorrect.". Now, how the hell did the postcard get delivered, to the correct address, but the package didn't!?  Anyway, the instructions on the postcard said I should stop by some regional distribution centre and pickup the package myself!  What Cheek.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, in my new found grief for UPS, I started stalking the brown trucks, imagining interesting ways to render them useless, or abduct the drivers and subject them to something as evil as working for edocs. On the side of these butt-ugly trucks is a UPS national call centre number: &lt;b&gt;1-800-PICK-UPS&lt;/b&gt;. I just chuckled - Idjits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Flicker of existence&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If I set the blinds to slits, and wait for the sun to set and the lights to come on.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If I sit here on this chair and try catch a glimpse of the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;(If I feel the need to write about something like this, what the hell...)&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If I bob my head up and down in time with some stupid song I've heard over and over...&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;... the lights behind the slits in the sunless outside seem to flicker, strobe.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Hmm, NaNoWriMo is weighing heavy on my lazy mind.  I feel like I want to achieve something like that, but at the same time I keep thinking I don't have what it takes to write a journal entry for each day of a whole month.  What the hell would I write about anyway?  I also have an impending trip back to SA. (oh, you just have to enter a novel by the 30th. - that's better.)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Where has all my energy gone?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Burning trees, dripping to the ground&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;6 hours drive, for what should have been 3, we arrived in Sugarbush Ski Resort, Vermont. The place we're staying in, owned by a very magnamonous colleague, is great.  Dressed to the nines, as much as a condo in a resort could be.  This place oozes quality.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After much Agave and cervezas, went to bed in a total chill on Friday night.  I don't think I've ever felt this good off alcohol before. Woke up around 10:30 ish, to a cup of tea and bacon and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, we hopped in the car in search of a special cheese factory, which we couldn't find.  Still, the view from the window world whizzing by was mindblowing. I've never seen such lively colours before.  Some trees were yellow as the ass of a bumblebee, while others loooked like they were on fire. Meadows of green, white picket fences and this sea of yellow and red.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We decided to take a walk to the summit of the range, up an autumn ski-route. Pretty tough on the calves, but the view from the top was worth it.  It was great to feel warm underneath a jacket, in the middle of nowhere, and enjoying the cold breeze against the face.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We got back to some hot tea, and some games of cards by the fire.  The rest of the evening went something like: "Eat, Drink and be merry." :) Thats when I started writing this entry.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've only just half-finished it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Lost in you&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Fluffy rug, thick and hearty, my back over the length of it.  Intoxicated with red wine, enjoying the moment. Your bum, alongside but close to my hip, your legs stretched out towards the fire that burns behind you.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Songs fill the air, songs of favour, songs of loneliness.  I can't figure out if it is my mind dictating the chorus, or its actually a recognised artist. Your eyes reflect the flickering fire bouncing off the walls, they're fixated on my face, my smile.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You're savouring my every word, as if it was the sweet caress of chocolate on your tongue.  When I make you laugh, its like I'm tickling inside, I know that you're so into me, you're almost helpless, and I'm your guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Your elbow, once or deemed sharp, is softly sprawled over my stomach.  You're as a light as the kiss of an angel, you couldn't harm anything.  I just want to hold you, my fragile.  You're like butter in my hands, melting and slipping through my figners.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;My palm stretches from the base of your chin while my fingertips tickle your ear, you're so delicate.  My thumb could wipe a tear from the groove beneath your eye, but you're not crying. When you close your eyes like you do now, I know you can feel me.  You press your face against my hand, wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;My hand is really just a junction between two great sources of energy, I want to share all mine with you.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Two weeks ago the following happened...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Synchronous in thought. Synchronous in action.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Distance between each-other equivalent.  Distance in mindset non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Speed limit increased.  Valves openly respond.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Consumption up, oxygen short.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Its almost 8PM, I'm sitting here in the car after a hard gym session, waiting for Mandy and Gareth to finish their sets.  Dodging the weird glances from the leaving ignorants.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between jotting down thoughts in paper vs sitting in the car with the laptop in front of you.  Maybe the weird stares are based off my ability to type in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The gymming fraternity is a whacky lot.  Some people are so obsessed with their appearance they could be classed in the same category as anorexics.  Its a sickness.  Some stare for ages at their bodies in the mirror.  Frankly, I don't understand what women see in men who are overly huge from working out so much. Even ape-like.  They even LOOK stupid.  I wonder how many of them could jog a mile?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;But thats me, being judgemental again.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Got word we're going on holiday soon. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Then today, 9PM EDT (or is that EST?) on a week ago.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Work has been terrible.  I've been battling to concentrate, even trying to organise tasks into priorities results in procrastination.  I was at my wit's end when I was verbally reprimanded for my &lt;cite&gt;lack of performance&lt;/cite&gt; by one of the big boys.  This just got me more upset, especially when I found out &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; my performance was being evaluated.  A few frantic phonecalls to the captain back home and I was on a new course, Destination: Relaxation, only I had to get out of the rough seas first.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've been escaping into my gaming, playing lots of Warcarft III, and being totally mindless.  Watching TV is bad, especially all the crap they play on the hundreds of TV channels here.  Its so addictive, I suck on a beer, chow on my oily crisps and feel my mind dribble out my nose. At least I'm still drinking Heineken and not sagging to low standards such as Bud.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The social scene is non-existent, except chilling with Mandy and Gareth.  Did lots of day-walking last weekend around some beautiful reservations in Boston.  One within walking distance of our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Also today, 9:15PM ED/ST (bleh: +5 GMT) on this weekend.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Beunos Noches Mis Amigos! (Hope my spelling is right)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Work had an end in sight, and after being &lt;cite&gt;told off&lt;/cite&gt; I had new direction and a goal to work towards. It goes a little something like this...&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Cake performed at the Orpheum theatre in downtown Boston. These guys are amazing. The whole way thru the concert I thought of Dudditts and Mc and how a joint would really go down well.  Cake are as good, if not better performing live.  They played classic singles such as "Comfort Eagle", "Rock &amp;amp; Roll Lifestyle" and "Never There".  Some of the new stuff was good too, most notably: "No Phone". I left with a smile on my face knowing I had fulfilled a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a theme for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Friday night, we got home early-ish to pack. The company, in all its evil glory, had allowed us 4 days of vacationing in the destination of our choice under $500.  So we chose a package deal to Cancun, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Early Saturday morning, Mandy and I met up with Gareth in Cambridge and caught a lift into the airport for a sunrise flight to the land of short smiling people.  The flights were OK, got to see "The Terminal" finally, which I enjoyed.  When we touched down in Cancun, I was grinning from ear-to-ear, here I was, in a totally alien place, faced with a foreign languange and a huge foo-fighting itenerary.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We picked up our rental car after queueing for hours in typical third-world-and-kinda-welcoming fashion, glistening with sweat from the humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The drive into Cancun was effortless, especially with Gareth (our intrepid interpretor and been-there-done-that kinda guy) at the helm.  Meh-Hee-Co, as pronounced by the locals, is like South Africa, with Botswana flavour, short jolly people and massive american cars.  It felt like home.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Our hotel was exactly what I expected, mass populace, low on maintenance and always looked better in the brochure.  That didn't get in the way with bumming on the beach or driving the Yucatan flat.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Our first full day we survived the drive to Tulum to see the seaside ruins left by the Toltecs and Mayans. (Well, technically the Spanish Conquistadors left what was left-over. Pigs.) The contrast between age-old stone, white beach, green palms and azure seas is a spectacle everyone should see before they die.  On the way back, we stopped off in Peurto Morales to catch some snorkelling and local flavours.  Picture it: dining in a cheesy Mexican, beach-fronting restaurant, sipping on cervezas and even catching a song or two from the local talent. I finally felt like I was relaxing. After wrapping up a mildly mannered meal, we were off to test the theory that one should never swim after lunch.  We were in for some luck.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;$20 later, we found a boatsman, Jose (fancy that!), gear and that exciting feeling in your stomach.  After testing out the equipment, we were on our way towards the reef.  Donning the flippers and mask, and diving into the water, I was bitterly disappointed.  Frikkin sea grass or some macro algae as far as the underwater eye could see. :(&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;(Un)Fortunately we all had to wear life-vests and follow the boatsman-cum-diving-guide on a tour of the waters.  My disappointment quickly subsided (like I would've if it wasn't for the lifevest) when I first caught sight of a huge stack of brain coral, in very good nick.  Infused over its own patterns were shimmering patterns of schooling fish, beautiful!  Lone stacks of coral led to complex condos of piscine splendour. Parrotfish, Grey Angelfish, Trumpetfish, Boxfish, Neon Gobies, jeepers.  If I could let my jaw drop I would, but it was too busy keeping the snorkel in place.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After an hour floating in the cool waters, abusing a poor starfish, and watching Gareth crap himself underwater from a Moray Eel, it was time to get back to the boat.  At this stage I had a headache from the pressure of diving too deep after our tour guide gave us the go ahead to ditch the life-vests.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Day two was an early start, for Chichen Itza. After two hours of driving the poor Nissan Tsuru flat out on the road thru the jungle, we arrived at Chichen Itza with new found legs and a zest to see what the fuss was all about. Trees gave way to a huge grassy lawn and one towering temple in the form of El Castillo, a stone and earth calendar as old as mayan recorded time.  Toltecs had built over most of the Mayan temples, shrines to the shedding of human blood.  Grim, yes. Mysterious, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed the Steam Rooms and the Observatory, followed by the view from the top of El Castillo and the endless columns.  The heavens opened in sheer tropical fashion just as we were making our way back to the car, good timing from the rain-god: Chac Mool. I bought a fantastic medallion depiction of Quetzalcoatl, the man himself, for the bargain price of 200 Pesos.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The route back was uneventful besides some wild driving antics a-la-Gareth and stopping for a few snaps of the cloudy skies, jungle and road. The extended metaphor that is my life. We chilled like we did all the previous days, walking on the beach, sipping beers and watching the hours tick by.  That evening after a better than average meal and one too many glasses of wine, Mandy and I dipped our toes in the night-time Atlantic and caught up on some heart-to-heart stuff.  One particular wave carried in a luminescent creature the size of a small bead, a dazzling blue, as if the day time sea colour was thousands of these little living gems.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Day three, Mandy and Gareth got up early to catch the sunrise while I prayed to the slumber gods.  After packing up, we were abusing our little Nissan again to catch the midday flight in time.  Getting back into the US was particularly painful. Customs were their typical anal selves. I kept asking myself: Why do I feel like a criminal?  Thoughts of wanting to flee gave way to feelings of familiarity, home almost.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Also today, 10:15PM&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Its now my little brother's Birthday. Best wishes Mike, for your 23rd Birthday. I hope to spend more with you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This weekend we're cruising up to Vermont, to catch the autumn / fall in all its fiery glory. I just hope I don't have too much work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So long for now people. Remember, this is a two way-street.  I'll post photos some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Pooch on the porch in a puddle of self-pity&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You've got this hold over me.  It's all embracing, strong.  There's nothing I can do to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It's like being the most energetic pooch ever, but being leashed by a 10 foot chain of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All I want to do is go rolling in the mud, or play frisbee all day down at the park, instead, I choke on this restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When you pet me, all is forgiven.  I love you in a slobbery fest of energy and tail-wagging.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;But I am just a simple minded dog, expensible and shorter lived than my master.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Do I leash myself?  Is my master upset with me?  Am I locked to this spot out of my own thoughtless actions?  I promise to leave the cat alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Locked&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at me with your tear-soaked eyes and know you're looking at me, the person inside. You would smile, I would smile, sniffing away the last tear. Facing each other, I lift my hand, fingers outstretched to wipe away the tears from your hauntingly beautiful eyes.  You start crying again. I hold you tighter. In that moment, I know that its all going to be alright and so do you.  Theres a themesong playing, something timeless, something we own in our memories.  Everytime I hear that song, I think of you and know you think of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Walking the path, without shoes.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Work = bad right?  Well, while it really has been bad, its also been amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Behind all the friviluous machinations that is corporate policy, and feeling like a number all over again, I feel like I've grown.  The responsibilities are starting to load up, most of them good responsibilities.  The type that you don't have to be a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Way back when, when I was young and naive, (wait, I still am! :P) I told myself I would never stop being a techie.  I'd much rather have my head buried in code than worry about managing a project or a team of people.  That's changed.  I'm feeling empowered, and revel in the opportunity to lead a team, impart knowledge on my peers, superiors and subordinates (damn, thats a terrible word).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Recently edocs gave me the opportunity to conduct a techinal interview with a potential new applicant. I felt more nervous than the applicant, but in the end it went off well.  Its great to reach out on a personal level almost, not just: "Pass this parameter please".&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've also been doing some research into the possibility of running a school of sorts within edocs.  HTML and CSS skills are lacking, so I approached the &lt;acronym title="Vice President"&gt;VP&lt;/acronym&gt; with a plan, which he accepted and wants me to do more research.  Within a few weeks I should hopefully be running 2-hour-long courses on web standards related HTML and CSS to any edocs people who are interested.  It's going to be challenging, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Other than that, with Tai, the Senior UI Developer on his &lt;a href="http://think-360.blogspot.com" title="Browse.To: Tonic Boy's Travels"&gt;blog-driven 2 month sabbatical&lt;/a&gt;, I've had to take on a lot of the work he'd usually do.  One such project is an internal development kit for new client projects. Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In general, I'm feeling like a different person.  I was browsing through some old photos from the beginning of the trip (in June) and hardly recognised the skinny dork in all the photos.  It's amazing what a different diet and a loose gym routine can do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Ignorance &amp;gt; Islam&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This is something I just want to get off my chest.  Here in the land of the "free" they have a keen distaste for islamic people. Granted, its a sweeping generalisation, but it still occurs.  Here in the land of the "liberated", terrorism is associated with Islam.  People, please, get it in your media-tuned minds that just because a bunch of fundamentalists cause a country so much grief, doesn't mean that the religion they so unshamelessly bastadardised is evil too.  In fact, I'd say many western civilists have much to learn about such rich and devoted religions as Islam and Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Here, if you're a "towel-head", even Indian, you're going to be repressed.  So much for the land of the "free" eh?  Talk about double standards.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;One question remains though: Why? Why the WTC in the most cosmopolitan city in the states?  I've never seen so many South and Central Americans, Pakistanis and Hindus in one city.  If you want to bomb america, at least do a good job and get rid of the towers of untruth in the form of media magnates and the towers of such sick "liberties" as the pr0n industry. Ask yourself Why America.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As for this shazbot debacle in the form of elections, who the hell does a red-neck or a banker vote for?  You have George "Dubya" Bush (what kinda nickname is that - testament to the bastardisation of the western civilised), or even John Kerry.  Not a great list of candidates eh?  Frankly, as Gareth says, I would vote against Bush rather than voting for Kerry.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm so glad I don't live here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Intellectual Whore, a.k.a.: Yours Truly&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Hello netizens and blogophiles.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I had a naais weekend!  Sheesh.  It's not everyday one gets an opportunity to go see the men's finals of the US Open hey?  Well, What a pity it was a such a walk-over.  Hewitt was totally outclassed.  Filthy Aussies.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Just before lunch on Saturday we drove down to NYC in a relaxed fashion (well, Gareth drove) and arrived in Queens, NYC in good time.  After chilling out for a while we took the subway into town to watch the ladies finals in Rockerfeller center, where they'd rigged up a huge screen on some grass inbetween the skyscrapers. Cool aura!  After stretching our backs out on the lawn, we decided to head into Central Park rather.  Central Park is uber.  It is the peanut in the dreadfully-bad-for-you M&amp;amp;M.  On one of the roads cutting through the park, a music tent pumped out beefy tunes faster than an italian sausage machine.  This was the cheesy dog, this was the butter on the popcorn.  Rollerbladers in their hundreds were jiving and jamming to the beat all having an excellent time, I couldn't help but smile and try and sway too. :)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We didn't venture far into central park, but managed to catch some great blues at this one fountain and stair-case area I've seen in countless movies and Law &amp;amp; Order episodes. (oh, they had a 14 episode L&amp;amp;O marathon last monday, over labo(u)r day.)  We headed back into Queens to freshen and dress up to get down to Greenwich Village.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We heard of a kewl bluesy, rockish place with a low cover-charge called the Bitter End, and after negotiating with the maitre'd got in @ $5.  The first group were a blues / rock / rap hybrid with good stage presence and poor mixing.  Only after 3 Corona's could I actually hear what the lead singer was banging on about: "Scotch!".  The second group was as awful as the lead singer slash pianist's sweaty pink shirt.  Their cover of The Doobie Brothers - Last Train Running was OK.  After some AwEsOmE pizza, we decided to take a cab to Ground Zero to see the great beams of light they'd rigged up for 9/11, I mean, 11/9.  About 40 "Space Cannons" per "Tower" all speckled in the night by masses of moths, beams that stretched to heaven itself.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The next morning I was woken to tea prepared by a zesty scottish lass, a room-mate of a John's. Norma's friend and fellow eire, Norma is Gareth Gareth's girlfriend, and Gareth Gareth is Gareth's buddy. :P&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After shooting the proverbial breeze with the two room-mates, the other one: Violet, we headed to Gareth Gareth's place where we hooked up for a greasy breakfast and coffee at a place called the Copper Kettle.  Damn, it was good :)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We took the subway East into Flushing Meadows and took in the vibe at the Open.  After finding our seats and starting to burn in the sun, we milled around waiting for the Men's Final to start.  When it did, we were 1 beer under already and having a kewl time.  Pity the game was such a white-wash. Six love, Seven Six, Six Love. Thats a numerical representation of a sore ass.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We left NYC at about 9PM, got stuck in traffic outside of Hartford CT, and finally made it home at 1AM.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Whole again...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Its been a splendid and boring week. SepArate, conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;h4&gt;Work Hat&lt;/h4&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Imagine being the only english speaker, maybe even british, in a sea of amazonian pygmies.  Pygmies that feed off grubs and maize. You can't speak pygmy.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that you have to work with them in building a hotel, a hotel the likes of which, the world has never seen.  It's mind blowing in stature and budget. It has the latest and greatest architecture, but the problem is, its being built by pygmies, and a tongue-less outsider suffering from Malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Not only do these pygmies prance around with little to nothing around their waists, but the women look terrible, at least I could use them to store all my pens. They're monkeys with advanced clicking routines (har har), does that make them human?&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I still haven't gone to see the shaman.  He's a wise old man apparently (something I picked up from a rather vocal pygmylet, clicking and waving his hands like an orangutan on speed).  I'm sure this shaman is doping the water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The village also has its own fresh supply of dodgy promiscuious women...  ...and many happy clients.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;h4&gt;Play Hat&lt;/h4&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I haven't played warcraft for a week.  Its kinda crap that way, cos I like the time to myself.  But damn, after a busy weekend, who has time for that!&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Simon, Mandy and I drove to &lt;a href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/newengland/ParkInfo/index.asp" title="Browse.to: SixFlags Theme Parks"&gt;SixFlags New England&lt;/a&gt;.  We arrived just before the crowds rocked up on a blistering hot autumn day, midday. This place makes Ratanga Junction look spastic.  8 roller-coasters, bungee chairs, water rides as far as the eye can see.  Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The first ride we went on, after much deliberation, was the Bungee Chair (don't know what its really called, but its basically a chair you sit in, that shoots up a rail, all on air.  Strapping in, I was quite nervous, visibly shaking hands and talking crap.  We had queued for 30 minutes or so, just for this ride.  Strapped in, we all had apprehensive smiles on our faces.  The chair lifted slightly to measure the weight of its occupants and start filling the huge air cylinder within the rail column.  In what must have been a split second, we were at the top of the 50-70m column, screaming our asses off like hysterical children.  What a rush!&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Simon ended up being 2 inches too tall for the Superman ride, which in my opinion was the best ride in the park.  Whilst Mandy and I queued, two people fainted in the heat!  It was about an hour long queue which left us relieved after the sign said it would be 90-120minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;For my first experience on a roller-coaster, it was truly amazing.  I was squealing like a girl the whole trip, heavy positive G's, followed immediately by mind-blowing negative G's. Very smooth.  Sheesh, I can still feel that exhiliration.  Mandy wasn't really vocal on the ride, but I was going: "OH MY WOOORD!!!" and "YEEEHAAA!!!".  Hehe :)&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The rest of the rides were a bit of an anti-climax, especially after the onsetting low of the receding adrenaline.  Also, I think I was spoilt by taking the best roller coaster first. After a short lunch, we ventured deeper into the park. Batman was kewl, you sat in chairs that allowed you to dangle your feet over the edge.  Much more jinking, Mandy bumped her head against the side of the restrainers. :(  Otherwise, too short!&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;We went on some of the older wooden roller coasters, rickety is surely the word to describe these machines.  Bone crunching.  The last ride we took at the park was a terribly old coaster, Simon and I sat in the last row, one of the drops, it felt like my spine had been compacted!  Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The drive home was long, but it was good to get back to the hotel.  I crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Sunday was spent in town, after driving in, we walked to the nearest station and took a train towards the Gardner Musuem, south of Fenway Park.  Here, we saw the first evidence of crimes, baseball smashed windscreens in parked cars.  Dodgy hood.  The Gardner musuem was amazing, an old house, whos owner saught to collect fine arts, works of Rapheal, Rembrandt.  Some of the art was inspiring, but I think we spent too much time there.  We made it back to the general vicinity of our car park, then did some shopping.  Prudential Center, Copley Square, sheesh, a shoppers dream.  But insanely busy. :(&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;After dropping Simon off at the airport, we drove the hour-long-trip back home and settled in for the night after doing washing and going over a few photos.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Today was spent on my back, watching back to back episodes of Law and Order, followed by some Warcraft and a great walk around Westborough.  I installed Tribes Vengeance on my laptop again, and this time it worked!  Albeit at 640x480. :(  Still, its playable and loads of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;h4&gt;That grey area where hats don't fit&lt;/h4&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Mandy got me thinking quite a bit about the trip here.  She's feeling homesick, probably due to the new environnment here.  Its been little over 9 days for her now.  Anyway, this time this trip is totally different.  I've refused to spend any over-time on any of the projects I'm busy on, probably cos I'm not that visible on the project and doing some real lousy work.  So, its like my heart is not in it.  I'll give it another week to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;The storm is over&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The sun is low, yet warm.  A calm breeze filters over the bay, crisp, refreshing.  Palm trees play in the whisper of the wind, fondling with their fronds.  The water hints of refreshing calm, lapping gently against the sand.  Foot prints, one set deep and long, the other graceful and, perfect.  Shadows within foot prints, speak at length of time's journey itself.  They tell of great stories, even sad stories, stories of an epic journey, stories of love.  Each shadow within each foot print is different to the preceeding one, unique as the amount of pressure applied with each step.  The sets move between each other, sometimes playfully facing the wrong, nay, the direction they've come from.  Crossing over, darting between.  The lighter foot prints often masked by the greater foot prints, inferior in size, yet so amazingly powerful.  This, my friends, is the tracking of a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Cloth in the wind, light and flowing. Soft as the sand, caressing her skin under its veil. So very soft.  So soft its melting me like wax from a flame, burning in the middle, burning inside. Wax dripping itself in that heart of fire, evaporating in the presence of such passion. Reforming, reshaping, resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Eyes locked, neck and body twisting to maintain that connection.  No care, not even worrying about the next step, new feelings brewing with each step.  New stories to tell in their foot print shadows. Tales of learning of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Her words, little darts of poison. Poison, entering thru the ears, going directly to my brain, little assassins.  I am defenseless, on purpose.  Poison, so sweet, tasting her vanilla words, flavours of devotion with hints of affection. So savoury. Savouring, yes, I wish time could die, but at the same time, let the wind keep blowing, playing with her hair, the wavelets tickling the beach with little whoops of glee, her smiling, moving her head the way she does that drives me insane, her eyes, burning holes inside me, igniting a feeling within me, a feeling ready to explode, explode with great fire, water and wind all at the same time. The sun should behave itself and not set on that day.  That would be cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A great day indeed.  We put in some time to show Mandy and Simon the southern and chilled part of Boston, before dropping Simon back off at the Airport.  Mandy seems to be settling OK, caught in holiday mode, which should all end tomorrow :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After doing some hectic shopping, we went for a walk, the same walk I did a while back, around the back of the hotel through the lucious suburbs of Westborough.  Its always great to get to know someone you come into contact with on a daily basis.  I really enjoyed my time. Especially the chocolate sundae, covered with nuts and one cherry.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After returning, and showering, I was back on the road again to meet up with a friend from work, Jessica, and two good friends of hers (one her boyfriend :P).  We watched Hero, well, I didn't just watch it, I sat in awe the whole movie, how very peaceful.  Very elemental, natural yet surreal.  A movie worth watching for a change.  A great way to end a chilled and invigorating day. Jay and Kay will specifically enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;No score and seven days?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Its been an interesting week for this here body.  Last weekend we went through to Cambridge after meeting some souf efficans online at &lt;a href="http://www.amaboston.com"&gt;amaboston.com&lt;/a&gt;.  A delayed view of the Tri Nations final ensued, followed by many beers and a braai of great beef indulgence. (and some fish)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Sunday was spent having a wicked breakfast, playing Warcraft 3 on &lt;a href="http://www.battle.net/war3/ladder/W3XP-player-profile.aspx?Gateway=Azeroth&amp;PlayerName=nDorfin" title="Browse.to: My WC3 Ladder profile"&gt;US East&lt;/a&gt; (doing OK &lt;acronym title="at the moment"&gt;atm&lt;/acronym&gt;), arbing around and just generally watching time pass with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Last friday, I was bitching about the social templates, and like a true sheep I followed my shepherd to 3 functions in one week...&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On tuesday, we cracked an invite from some of the edocs goons to go on a booze cruise around Boston harbour, sponsored by BIMA and Google.  200 people on one huge yacht, free booze, excellent company and some crap music. We popped thru to an underground pub / cigar lounge thing afterwards, I obviously wasn't drunk enough.  Then followed by some Chinese food, now normally I'm quite hesitant to try anything oriental, but these dishes were superb.  A great way to end a kewl evening.  Got back to the hotel at 2AM. *heh*&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Today, at 5PM or so, we're heading thru to my first baseball experinece.  The Sox are playing Detroit at Fenway Park, the mecca of all baseball fans.  Should be a thrashing.  Lets hope the baseball isn't as boring as it is on TV :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Then on Saturday, we've got two colleagues from SA joining us for some work over here.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Gym is really helping at the moment.  'Been going 3 times a week (minimum).  Feeling more confident, energetic (when I don't go to sleep at 2AM :P) and just healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Stop press.  Went to my first baseball game with some colleagues from the office.  The Sox were playing Detroit, so we scalped some tickets after a few beers at a pub just down the road from Fenway Park and tried to watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The baseball itself was really boring, but the atmosphere was amazing. The hot dogs were greasy, but just what the doctor ordered after a few pints and double shot of tequila. :P  After the game (a convincing win apparently) we took the 'T' into Boston's market area to check out the nightlife.  We ended up in a great irish pub called the Black Rose and listened to an Irish Folk band play some great music (maybe I was pissed?).  At 12:10 we had to high-tail it back to the train station to catch the last train home.  Got back "home" at 2AM.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mandy and Simon, another two colleagues from SA joined us today.  Go team!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;This Raging Sociophobe&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Fuck you social types.  You stink.
			You're false, you need cheap mediums to have cheap thrills. You're all so false.
			Thats the alcohol talking, thats the cigarette in your yellow fingers sending visual vibes of confidence.  You're so self-concious you think smoking can help.
			You might have perfect teeth, but you eat shit.  Your breath smells like mint, but you've got crap rotting in your stomach.  Festering.
			You wear make-up to hide the monster beneath, a mask to keep the puss from dripping out.
			You click amongst each other, in some sort of cacophony of whoops and fake sounds.  I don't have the voicebox for that, but I can hear it.  I want to rip out my ear-drums.
			You think you're all perfect, yet you're all so insecure.  You think you're all unique, yet you herd like domesticated beasts before an abbatoir and you can't smell the blood in the air.  All you see is the ass in your face from the beast in front of you.  Mindless.
			You all conform, and think the unconformists are the ones that break the social clothing order.  You're all zombies.
			Thats the media thinking.  Thats your idea of what a conformist should do.  Thats your sense of fashion.  What the fuck is fashion anyway?  Fashion is just uniforms for slaves.
			Fuck you hollywood and all the filth you spread.  You're a disease.  You are herpes of the heighest and itchy-ist order and everyone shags you.  You filthy whore.  Go and clean yourself up before you get judged.  Take that bleach and wash away all that dirt, you maggot infested living corpse.
		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;This time tomorrow&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;... I'll be back on that airplane, headed to the otherside of the ocean to pursue my career, build my knowledge and find life.  Again.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks have flown by, *cough* but they've also been buried under contemplation, almost consuming.  That last dream is just evidence of whats been going thru my head.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I still can't figure out if this trip is gonna be good or not.  I know its good for my profesional life, but I think the novelty has worn off.  Its like a trip to a working holiday, not really a holiday in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It'll be a hard routine again, but something I'm sorta looking forward to.  It'll be good to get back into Gym, see New England during fall, and spend time with more strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;I'm cross with myself&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Fucking obscurity.  The beauty of grey is no beauty, its a curse.  Black and White, now thats pretty / predictable.  Black is dark, white is light, harbringers of doom, prophets of good.  There is no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Grey is faceless, a void, an empty space.  Grey is neither consuming nor generous.  Its just there to piss me off.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Its the "I don't know" and the "Whatever" intwined, wrapped around itself like a narcissistic being with ten eyes and ten hands, each holding a mirror aimed inwards.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Grey is pain, grey is selfish.  Grey is just a name, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Erm...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Part of me wants to disappear into that grey.  Become lost.  Forget everyone I know and just vanish.  Escape even?  Change my name, unofficially of course. Forget everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Am I not enough of a shadow already?  I'm not a shadow, I'm a shadow of a shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I could escape this life, escape all it means to everyone else.  No-one would know.  Why do I feel like that?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I already feel like I'm not in contact with my friends enough, like I'm shedding skin. This is a new bug-eyed lizzard version underneath, another malt to go.  I've outgrown everyone already, nobody can keep up.  Where are the new versions of friends that were meant to be released 2 weeks ago?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Here I am, filling this with bytes.  Bites that fill?  Fill those bitemarks!  What drives me to write?  I used to think I could write, but this isn't writing, this is just another time demanding and consuming exercise. I'm sad, I'm in love with morbid music, I'm lonely, and sometimes it feels good.  Sometimes I just want to cry, cos a song can mean so much.  touch you inside like a swallowed capsule of electricity.  slowly it digest, then explodes within.  writhing and contorting, your body reacts.  limbs in the air at pace, in unknown directions.  no master of this ship, just rudders and bows cutting the water.  raining on the water.  ripples, in every direction.  ripples, contorting and distorting the placid surface, sends shimmering light to the eyes below, looking up, like the sky will fall on their heads.  eyes, so consumed in staring up, oblivious to the world within.  a peaceful world, a world of wonder.  a blue world.  danger lurks but is accepted.  its fluid fate I tell you.  shimmering on the sharp rocks and coral, waving in the waves. why am I here in the water when I could surely fly above it. I have wings, they propel me thru the water effortlessly, all I need to do is stick my head out the water and give it a shot.  shoot up like a bullet, giving it my all, erupt from the surface, feel the air course over my slippery exterior, feel the sun.  I couldn't get bored of flight.  I'm a bird, and all I do is fly.  Its so boring.  Now I'm a man, Sitting in my boat, lean to the edge.  Put your weight into the roll, till you can see your reflection in the water.  Push it a little further till your nose touches the water.  take your last breath.  push it further.  put your eyes under, and see. see like you've never seen before. push it further.  put your ears under the water, let the water fill your drums, pillowing out the sounds beneath, but still listening. New sounds.  Take a deep breath and kiss your air breathing existence goodbye. I'm a fish and my fishtank owner has lost the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Tick Tock...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This weekend was total crap, yet productive.  I literally locked myself in my room like a little hermit and grafted. I've now got a presentation for tomorrow that looks relatively spiffy, worked on my project for edocs and killed time watching Millennium Season 1 and the Back to the Future Trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did was clean out my fishtank.  The poor fuckers, I feel so shit.  2 and half months or more without guidance.  Months before that of neglect.  It was amazing to find most of them still alive.  I'm such a terrible pet owner.  So I put them out of their misery and cleaned out the tank.  Like I'm closing another chapter in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've had fishtanks since I've had pubic hair.  I even used to work in a Tropical Fish store. The tank is state of the art, with an expensive filter, automatic lights, the whole shebang. Just an incompetent owner. I've done the Amazon thing, the community tank thing, and now just failed at the African Rift Lake setup.  Its my lack of self-discipline.  Its my lack of compassion.  Poor fish.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;No time for anything, yet always time to procrastinate.  Procrastination is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Dreams and their meanings&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Last night, or rather, this morning, I had a really vivid dream.  I almost forgot about it, but there was something so insanely visual about it that I remembered, and therefore remembered the rest of the dream.  I'd like to know what you guys interpret from such a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm on a beach at sunset.  Think of that beach in Contact.  The beach has a really slow slope towards the water, white fine sand, like linen under the feet.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The water is very still, not a wave in sight, yet the water is crisp and clean.  Dark blue, almost navy.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The air is warm, giving a temperate or tropical feeling.  There is no wind, pronouncing the stillness of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The more I look at the low sun, the more it seems to disappear.  I know its still there, cos I can feel the warmth it emits. Each time I try look at the sun setting, the more the sun fades into obscurity and the darker the sky becomes around it, yet the rest of the sky is a bright cyan.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Soon the horizon is literally melting [heh, thanks Kerry :D] into the water, as the colours mix.  The sky becomes dark blue, and a few of the stars are starting to shine through.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Stars become little flashlights almost, pointed directly at me.  They're bleached white, yet emit expanding rings of setting-sun-coloured gas and fire.  Almost like they're going supernova, over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;There are a few dominant stars doing this, I can feel the radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I feel like I'm walking with someone I know and trust at this stage, as we continue walking along the beach...  Until we come across a group of people playing in the water. Some beached whales, the usual holiday fraternity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I feel like we're at a holiday resort.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Then I focus on one individual, a stocky, short-back-and-sides haircut jock, waist deep in the water.  He has a terrible sunburn pattern, stretching from his jaw line, to just above his muscular shoulders.  It is as rosey as drying blood.  As if he was wearing a helmet and a low cut blouse and lay in the sun all day.  The rest of his back and arms were fine.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I remember walking up to him and saying something along the lines of: "Dude, you're burning!  You should get out of the sun!"&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Then the dream ended.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Almost a week terug&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I think it took me almost 3 days to recover properly from differing timezones and little-to-no-sleep. Friday, we had an awesome day at Kyalami with the team, doing the BMW advanced driving course. I can still remember Carla's whoops of elation experienced in sliding a BMW thru 360 degrees, narrowly avoiding the instructor and coming to a halt off the skidpan.  Some great times indeed, adrenaline highs and the onset of the lows.&lt;br /&gt;
		My faith in the company is always improving, we've got a great team, all humble, all in it for each other. If ever there was a company I feel I could grow in, it would be Consology.  You guys rock!&lt;br /&gt;
		Weird that I'd think of a company that way, I've been from bad to worse in previous employment, the loose and cold feeling of a huge corprate to a tight and overzealous office run out of a home.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm back, things feel weird, exciting and downright scary, all at the same time.  Its great to be amongst my friends again.  Overseas, I resorted to keeping up to date with friends over MSN Messenger, and making some great new chat friends from all the four corners of the globe.  Now, back in this situation, its like I have little time for chat buddies.  Weird that. Its great to feel like I'm home, but I think I'm outgrowing my current place-where-I-rest-my-head.  After not having played games for almost 2 months, and now having played games almost all weekend, I almost feel sick, almost. (Grr, too much almost)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I miss such simple pleasures as efficiency, exercise and summer.  Winter here is just-plain-crap.  I'm also in limbo of sorts.  Edocs want us back on the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of August for another salvo, this time 3-6 months.  Winter in the States could be just-plain-nerve-racking, but another first-time experience.&lt;br /&gt;
		Tomorrow, I start work on an Edocs project from the Consology offices.  I've got to do some analytical work, something I haven't done for ages and should have more experience in. Pity, I was looking forward to working with the local crew. :(&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Hmm, work work work.  Blah blah fishpaste.  How about something else...&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I'm at that point in my life where I should consider starting investments.  Playing the stock excahange game, buying a house, that sorta thing.  It'll just have to wait for a few months while I earn some collateral and build my career 7000miles away.  (Grr, work is back)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ooer, on Tuesday, in my half-dazed state, I went with the boys to watch Hidalgo.  It made me think of Gladiator in many scenses, probably due to the filming effects such as the parched out exposure and the focusing on the charcter's features. For horse lovers, this movie would be an epic.  The plot wore a bit thin, but the message was good.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning, only after dreaming of Wacom Tablets.  What can one interpret from that?  Maybe: The bridge between biology and machinery? Or: The better tools of expression?  How about: Feeling freedom in terms of creation?  What do tablet owners think of their little tools? (Not those tools!)  Whacked.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;OK, this is bad.  I've spent an entire journal entry rattling off about my life.  Time to float...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speckled sun strobe sojourn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Transit. Wide windows open to the world. Skirting down a road thru nowhere, not a bump in the asphalt.  Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;
		A light fog blankets the valley off the port bow of your streamlined ship, unstirred by the morning sun slowly emerging from its restless nest.&lt;br /&gt;
		As the sun loosens its influence from the horizon, the light grows more intense, as if it too is renewed like that day you shall receive.&lt;br /&gt;
		Not another car in sight, you open the throttle up a bit, feeling the nervous stimulant tickle your veins like an unknown hand stroking the back of your shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
		In this moment, you feel, no, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; alive.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Wise old trees line the road, planted many generations ago by a farmer caught up in the simple pleasures of life. &lt;br /&gt;
		The suns rays streak through the spectating trees, golden hues fill the interior and light up the sticky dust on the windshield in flashes.  The faster you go, the faster it feels.&lt;br /&gt;
		Strobing streaks of sun, tricking your iris into closing your pupils, shielding your eyes like blast-shields and then immediately reacting by opening again to the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;
		Each time as they open, the receiving retina, ready for more, is blasted with fresh photons.  You can feel the intenisty.&lt;br /&gt;
		In this moment, you feel, no, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; invincible.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		Wise old trees turn to spirits, ancestors, egging you on to greatness.  You're in a race, and they're supporters, chanting your name.&lt;br /&gt;
		Excited fans, reaching to the skies with their arms and their eagerness, faceless yet familiar.&lt;br /&gt;
		Their shadows form interesting shapes in the road and offer your mind a brief harbour from all the painful seas, a place to play.&lt;br /&gt;
		The journey becomes easier, your mind refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;
		In this moment, everything feels, no, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; surreal.
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		You're the main star in an epic film, the camera is focused on you, the scene composed in that golden memory is perfect, and you're staring out the window.&lt;br /&gt;
		Its the sorta scene lovelost fools will watch cheap-reproductions-of for many years and know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how you feel.&lt;br /&gt;
		Its the sorta scene all aspiring directors would die to recreate, yet re-creation is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;
		You're the main star in your own epic, but its not yet time for the final credits.&lt;br /&gt;
		In this moment of moments, everything &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; perfect.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Typical&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As South African's we require visas for almost any country.  One such country is Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We booked a day over at the Sheraton in Frankfurt, after requesting a hotel within the airport terminals, explaining our visa predicament.  Today, when we arrived at Frankfurt Main, we discovered otherwise.  The hotel is outside the airport, and we need visas to leave.  ARGH!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So, we headed back the way we came, after getting felt up by the passport control nazis.  Only to discover AFTER being felt-up, that we couldn't enter back into the same terminal we just came from due to US flight restrictions.  To make matters worse, trying to head back into the terminal, our bags were checked more thoroughly than when we left.  Holds up anyone?  Certainly some double standards going on, if I was in the US, I'd hijack a plane leaving the US cos the security is so useless when departing.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We finally found a business lounge on the other side of the airport buildings, and have been here for over 4 hours now.  God bless showers, power outlets and even a little nook to catch some zeds. (err Zees?)  Gareth has crashed after a hang-over induced drowsiness, and I've been tinkering on my PC, sucking on caffeine and the measly bar snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The view out the window near my cubicle is just amazing though, and makes up for the crapness that is lack of understanding.  I've got a great view over a runway and 2 terminals, watching the lufthansa boeings and airbuses taxi, take off and land. There are about 5 C-5 Galaxy's parked on the opposite end of the runway.  NATO transport perhaps? The weather is crisp yet boring.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Decadency at forty-one thousand feet&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The meals were superb on the Lufthansa flight here.  Supper last night was Caesar salad, pancake filled with duck and melon, crisp rolls and FINALLY some wholewheat bread that actually tasted nutritious. The main course was a fat wad of beef sirloin as tender as fillet, potatoes au gratin and fresh satueed veggies. Desert was Haggen Dasz ice cream, dripping with caramel, bailey's irish cream and praline chocolates. Mmmm!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This morning we woke to fruit salad, muffins, omelette.  Bliss this is!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Splashing out&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Saturday, whilst waiting for Gareth to finish off his work, I learnt of an Apple store just up the road from the office in Natick.  After following our camp counsellor Larry (heh, the office space we sit in feels like a concentration camp, and Larry is our trustworthy uncle, always looking out for us) to the mall, we walked into the Apple store.  Apple stores are amazing things.  I walked out with a 20gb iPod maxi (the new model) and a carry-case for $330.  Pretty good.  iPod's packaging oozes style and well-thought-full-ness.  I'm still impressed :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've used 6 out of 20gb.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;The US and cell phones.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;1-800-&lt;acronym title="FFS"&gt;456!&lt;/acronym&gt;. The US has such a backwards cellphone industry.  They're in love with crappy flip-phones.  You pay for incoming calls and &lt;acronym title="Short Message Service"&gt;SMS&lt;/acronym&gt;'s. T-mobile in general just sucks.  I made 2 local calls, received 1 international, received 5 SMS's and sent about the same, in the space of 2 months. At $50 registration, I've been totally ripped off. Saturday, when I wanted to call Kerry in Canada (long-distance) I found out I didn't have any air-time!  Happy Days and Jubilation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Yet, the demand for edocs' products is outstanding in the US telco industry. European countries are picking up pace, but the bulk of work for edocs has been US based.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Starting to feel it...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;9 hours later, I feel bushed, even my bones are tired.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;A holiday in SA?&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;This sunday night, we'll be winging our way back to &lt;acronym title="South Africa, A country, Not a state."&gt;SA&lt;/acronym&gt;.  A lousy 28 hours of travelling. :(&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Thankfully we've got a booking at the Sheraton in Frankfurt, to sleep off the drowsiness and return balance due to the lack of sleep on the plane. What better way to get rid of 10 hours of stop-over than sleeping!&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Then, for 2 measly weeks, we're meant to work remotely on &lt;a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: Edocs.com"&gt;edocs&lt;/a&gt; stuff, from the Consology offices? Hello, I work for Consology! Once those 2 weeks are up, we're meant to either fly back here to Natick, MA, or some project in EU.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;Direction, or fumbling in the dark.&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Obviously, the topic of my career has come up again. While I have been blissfully in tune with my current scope, I was recently doing work that was totally and utterly, well, boring. If you're not learning, you're not really enjoying anything workwise.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't know, heres the scope of my work...&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;To be vague, I'm a web developer.  To be exact, I specialise in client-side markup and presentment in the form of &lt;acronym title="(eXtensible) HyperText Markup Language"&gt;(x)HTML&lt;/acronym&gt; and &lt;acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"&gt;CSS&lt;/acronym&gt;. "HTML, That's Easy!" I hear you say, and you'd be right. Now ask yourself, is your HTML accessible? Do you rely on table elements to layout your pages? Do you even have a proper &lt;acronym title="Document Type Definition"&gt;DTD&lt;/acronym&gt; entry in your pages and validate your markup against it? If your answers are Yes, No, Yes, you pass. :D&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;If not, you're probably part of that conciousness (or lack thereof) that believes that &lt;acronym title="Internet Exploder"&gt;IE&lt;/acronym&gt; is a good browser, Dreamweaver is the best web development &lt;acronym title="Integrated Development Environment"&gt;IDE&lt;/acronym&gt; ever and Accessibility is just a word.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;My job of late has been nothing of that, no excitement, no challenges (except the eternal testing of patience). Its been the use of a third-party translation tool (tool's the word!), with cruddy tag-soup that we HAVE to use, and to make matters worse, probably have to change. Like I normally do in any uncomfortable situation, I try escape.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After chatting to the &lt;acronym title="Vice President"&gt;VP&lt;/acronym&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: Edocs.com"&gt;edocs&lt;/a&gt; over lunch, I had a better idea of where I wanted to be, and my newly defined role within Consology and Edocs.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;I want to be one of the &lt;a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/" title="Browse.to: StopDesign.com"&gt;Douglas Bowman's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.meyerweb.com" title="Browse.to: MeyerWeb.com"&gt;Eric Meyer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.1976design.com" title="Browse.to: 1976Designs.com"&gt;Dunstan's&lt;/a&gt; of the wired world. But at the same time I want to be known as the guy who made web standards possible within a Big-Web-Application™ such as Edoc's &lt;acronym title="Telco Billing Manager"&gt;TBM&lt;/acronym&gt; product.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Is that too much to ask?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Slap my forehead for me, I missed an informal meeting of standards-savvy developers right here in Boston on the 13th. Guess I shoulda hooked up FeedReader ages ago :(&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;One step at a time&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Information analysis, learning, researching, diverging. It's all got to start, big time. I still want to give Struts / Tiles a shot, learn more about &lt;acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language"&gt;XML&lt;/acronym&gt; / &lt;acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics"&gt;SVG&lt;/acronym&gt;, maybe even some Java. Then Usability, Analysis, Architecture, sheesh. Where will I find the time?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; mood modulation...&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;blockquote&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
                 A signal, destination everywhere.  Broadcast like the scent of blood in the water, at propoganda speed and strength.&lt;br /&gt;
                 A transmitter, with its head in the clouds, always sending, obliviously.  Advertising like a bitch on heat.&lt;br /&gt;
                 Its sister receiver standing on tippy-toes, neglected, starting to feel demoted. Listening with its heart, but not really listening.&lt;br /&gt;
                 Maybe the answer is to just keep spewing, it defines me.  When you're defined by your output, is there room for input?&lt;br /&gt;
                 Where are the bloodthirsty sharks?  I don't see their fins pertruding from the cold waters...&lt;br /&gt;
                 Where are the technicians to fix this poor receiver?  I can't hear the aluminium clutter their ladders make.&lt;br /&gt;
                 Service requests sent and escalated.  Lost in upper management.
             &lt;/p&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
                 *dit dit dit..* Air - Alone in Kyoto, thanks Neill. *dit dit dit..*

    &lt;h3&gt;Learn what you already know?&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Why do artists go to college / varsity?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;I understand that there is much theory and practicality in doing a degree in say Fine Art, but in learning techniques and styles, is the artist not becoming just-another-templatised-artist?  Someone that can be categorised?  "Hmm, a wonderful abstract piece".  Surely art is something that's inside you?  Surely the best art is appealing in its uniqueness?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Most musicians learn how to play their instruments on their own, others go to classes to learn advanced techniques.  Pianists have to struggle at classes for years to be deemed high-class, garage bands strum until they find a kewl rhythym - Who is the better artist?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;A calling...&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know anything about counselling in South Africa? Do you need a degree?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;I've been giving some thought about doing a first year B.A Psych or some such, an introductory year?  Anyone done Psych101?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;blockquote&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;so whats the theme for the day??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;Pick one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;how about sunflowers??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;Always staring at the sun, petals reaching out to grab as much of the warmth as they can, at night they feel sad, their friend the sun has left them again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;they jostle for the suns love, trying to be the first awake, trying to be the last asleep, always attentive, always listening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;too happy for me to handle!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;OK, your turn...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;tell me about goldfish...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;goldfish?? where'd that come from??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;ok...lemme try&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;very suspicious...always on the lookout for somethin bad to happen to them...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;hungry in a very needy kinda way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;i'm not good at this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;go on!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;think about what they look like, what they must be thinking...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;very seedy eyes...thats prbbly cos they alwasy envy the other fish...bigger stronger..watever..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;very insecure most of the time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;thats probably why they travel in shoals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;heh, kewl!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;I like that seedy description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;ur just bein nice!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;no!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;You've made me look at goldfish differently now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;i dunno y i look at things so negatively&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;does that reflect on me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;in sum twisted way??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;it does a little&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;explore it, play with it...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;why are the goldfish suspicious?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;cos they're scared sum1 'll take wat they have away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;all the beauty thats around them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;...and now the positivity shines thru...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;no...they admire the beauty i guess but are jus so scared to be comfortable in the fact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;that it belongs to them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;and no1 can take that away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;your positivity was shining thru&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;was bein the keyword there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;jus a glimpse of it huh??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;b&gt;yes, build on it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;em&gt;yea i gotta try&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
             &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/blockquote&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Life is stimulating.  There is human essence and experience in everything we do. Greets to Divya.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;So this is what its all about...&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;On Saturday I spent about $600 on various gifts, clothes and sutff, all the while having fun doing it!  We've been getting a &lt;i&gt;per diem&lt;/i&gt; allowance since we arrived here: $50 a day for food, gas*err*petrol, and other amenities.  Like typical South African's we've been carpooling everywhere, eating bread and soup and watching excess expenditure.  Today we splashed out.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Yeah, 1 week now till we return.  I'm looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Watched an episode of Def Poetry last night.  Stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;blockquote&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;
                 A beggar and a liar, a streetfool hermit hooked on haze, hand-me-downs and honourless offerings.  Handouts are appreciated but the taste doesn't persist, like cheap bubblegum, better used at the bottom of a shoe.&lt;br /&gt;
                 How did I end up here, on the side of a road, hidden away in an alleyway, festering with the rats and roaches of this life.  How could anyone droop this low.  &lt;br /&gt;
                 I feel so dirty, that not even a trip through a carwash on the roofrack would help.  I feel dirty inside, forgotten and alone.  Like the blood on Macbeth's hands, you can never wash it off.  It's so dirty inside.&lt;br /&gt;
                 You pay me for my services as a hopeless soul, the one making you think you could be worse off, gratifying yourself with what you have, as if a nickel or a quarter is paying homage to your own dignity or keeps you from falling this low.  I have to spend everything you give me on escaping this tiring reality.&lt;br /&gt;
                 Might as well enjoy myself while I can right?  Who needs food for the body when you can lick intently on the delicacies of the brain.  It's too cold here anyway.  I need something to light me up from inside.&lt;br /&gt;
                 Do you really think you're helping me when you dish out your spare change?  Sure, my hand is extended...&lt;br /&gt;
                 ...but its not asking for money.
             &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Where is that full moon?&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;I'm feeling more useless than a &lt;acronym title="Kill Fucking Chickens"&gt;KFC&lt;/acronym&gt; bucket in the United Bloats of America, without the chicken.  I can't put my finger on it, but its probably this laborious and seriously boring work I've got to do atm.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;It could also be a total anti-climax after a weekend of thrills and pain.  (weird, I thought weekends lifted spirits, they did on Monday at any rate)&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;Mount Washington, nineteenhundredsomethingmeters, pfft!&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Can you imagine this hiker-who-doesn't-look-like-a-hiker actually climb a frikkin mountain?  One can't. Scathing. Scalding, hot water, please shut the tap off before I start leaking and turning your water red.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;In my dream, (cos thats what it is) there were 4 of us.  We arrived in New Hampshire early-ish (it felt early-ish) on Saturday morning...  It was really whacked, I dreamt I needed a piss-stop and at this weird little piss-stop, there were only vending machines and a small information kiosk.  Here we picked up a map of the area.  My requirement for a piss-stop vanished immediately and we were on the road again.  Weird huh?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection of the map, we read about a magical place called Flume Gorge. An old log-flume with some fantastic water works. (something KayCee would love to see, I thought to myself).  After dangling our possessed cameras in front of our eyes and not hearing the machinations churn inside for hours, we were caught in a loop of a trail around this watery-wonderland filled with other machinationless-camera-toting-individuals.  One pair of them even talked to me, it was surreal, there mouths didn't open but I could understand them!&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Then we mounted our chariot once again and headed to meet the wise-old-man-of-the-mountain.  Well, we avoided him actually and went to Pinkham Notch.  We had seen photos of the wise-old-man-of-the-mountain anyway, and even joked about his alter-ego, wise-guy-of-the-mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After handing our monopoly money over to a puckered-lipped-hotel-manager we had secured our beds for the night, but there was an insatiable need to first rid us of our afternoon.  Heh, buying beer in a dream is a unique experience, I felt like I wasn't dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After throwing rocks into the river till my arms hurt (In this dream I could throw with both arms, equally well) and enjoying a collection of niceties hot off the fire, it was time to head to the slumber hovel.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;How many of you dream you're sleeping?&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Early that next morning, we packed our kits and got on our respective steeds.  We were out for a killing, a bounty of epic-movie-based proportions.  Hell yeah, that first saloon we stopped at not only had hot news of our intended prey, but a pretty darn good eggs and bacon if I might say so myself.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After a goodbye kiss from the wenches, we rode into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Attitude determines altitude.  Well, it did on the way up.  Dirt trail became shale and loose rock.  Boulders sprouted, and grew. We struggled on, after shooting our horses.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;At one point we stopped and turned around and witnessed creation and it was amazing!  Seeing the Appalachians in all their glory is a sight to be seen, preferably from a few thousand feet up.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;One more section to go, the boulders turn to sharp craggy rocks, lined with our friend Lichen.  This part was tough!  Each step was a step towards the summit. At this point my brain in my dream was playing mental-challenge games with me, both booing and encouraging me.  MUST MAKE IT!  MUST SHOW THIS BEAST WHOS BOSS!  Hello, what's this? A car?! Here?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Talk about an anti-climax. Every Jim, Ed and Doris was at the top of this mountain, sucking on their low-carb-snacks admiring the view. There was no flag placement, no catching a breathe of fresh air, just jostling with the sugar-toting-sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;The trip down was harder on the knees, toes, shins, ankles, hamstrings, quads, calves and some unknown muscle groups than going up. My toes squealed under the vertical pressure like a piglet trapped beneath a press. Each step was a calculated move, often ending in an unculculated grimace.  But I and therefore we made it.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Fooood! Slops! Fresh T-Shirt! Relaxing time! We took a drive down the road to a local pub. I was the pre-determined designated driver, so I sucked on my shake / coffee / coke and scoffed down my burger whilst gleefully watching the 3 ou toppies gradually become children all over again.  Beer seems so much more effective after strenuous activities :D  We left about 3 hours or so later (it felt longer) and drove through plenty of small new-hampshire hamlets before coming across a peaceful lake just off the road to nowhere.  Drunken Courage prevailed, as the little babies clambered into the warm waters and played dodgems with the trout.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;After fending off the increasing number of spectators and getting the kids back into the car, we were finally on the road again.  The sun had set a long time ago, so it was after 9PM with 3 hours of driving left.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Those 3 hours passed quick enough, but when we arrived back at the hotel I was bushed.  Another hectic weekend under the belt. Did I mention this was a dream?  How could a netophile cross gamer geek like me seriously climb a mountain?  I'm warped.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;Splashing out on music is a good investment&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Almost a month ago, I bought:&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;ol&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the deaf&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;BT - Movement in Still Life&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;Audioslave - Audioslave&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;Incubus - Morning View&lt;/li&gt;
             &lt;li&gt;Seether  - Disclaimer&lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;/ol&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Of those 5, BT and Incubus stand shoulders above the rest. Movement in still life is an oldish electronica / euro-dance album with tracks as stead-fast as Godspeed and the smack-down Madskillz.  Recommended for any listener dreaming of the good old electronica days.&lt;br /&gt;
         Incubus just can't seem to do any wrong with this album.  After buying "Make Yourself" and burning holes in it, this seemed a logical purchase.  Pity I missed their concert here in Boston. :/&lt;br /&gt;
         Audioslave's album is incredible, but filled with nonsense towards the end, probably cos all the popular hits are in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;
         Queens of the Stone Age could be deemed repetitive, but they've got awesome riffs and good experi-metal tracks.&lt;br /&gt;
         Now Seether, eish, these guys have lost that rough diamond sound that made them so good.  The production on this US based disc is piss poor in comparison to Saron Gas's Fragile.  Its still good though.
         &lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;h3&gt;What else?&lt;/h3&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Our return tickets have been booked for the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July.  7 hours of flying to Frankfurt.  No less than 10 hours lay-over in Frankfurt, the worst airport in the world. 11 hours flight back home.  I hope I can sleep on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;We'll be back in &lt;acronym title="Souf Effica"&gt;SA&lt;/acronym&gt; in time for a Consology team-building event which is basically a day at the Kyalami Skid-pan playing with BMW's. After 14 or so days we'll probably be back on a plane to Boston again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Nitrogen...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
			Barometer drops, brewing clouds, thickening with renewal, laden with life.&lt;br /&gt;
			Primer drops, sacrificing themselves like lone lemmings, they're the brave ones.&lt;br /&gt;
			They escape the mass of thoughtless ones, the sky-borne social template types.&lt;br /&gt;
			Hurtling to earth, friction deforming them as they descend to their doom. Is it doom?&lt;br /&gt;
			Ground rush, adrenaline valves wide open, the closing of invisible eyes before the moment of impact.&lt;br /&gt;
			You're not alone, my brave friends.  You've inspired others, given them courage.&lt;br /&gt;
			With masses in safety, the escape from the uplift is achieved by pooling together.&lt;br /&gt;
			It's that moment where you feel alive, when the rain splashes down on everything it can touch.&lt;br /&gt;
			You can smell the fresh rain blood on the air, a massacre of molecules.&lt;br /&gt;
			The plants reach up towards the obscured sky, yearning for a drop in the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;
			Life is renewed, there is hope for another day, everything is relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;
			I want to be out there, jumping through the freshest of showers. I want you there with me.&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;25.02739726027397260273972602739726 years old&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A new month, a new year, a new journal entry.  New chances at life, new opportunities, new enemies and new friends.  One specially new friend, someone I can *really* talk to.  What a kewl birthday present - thanks Agent J for introducing us and Agent K for being who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I feel stoked, its amazing what a weekend away can do for your spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Washington DC, the sequel.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="photo cleft" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;amp;current=Manhattan.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &amp;gt; Zoomed in"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_manhattan.jpg" alt="Manhattan from da sky" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		It all started early on Saturday morning, too early in fact.  Remember what I was saying about efficiency?  We parked at a bus terminal and caught a bus into the airport.  Like clock work, the buses leave on the hour for the rather busy airport that is Logan International.  We self-checked-in and boarded the 737 destined for New York's La Guardia Aiport.  NYC is AMAZING from the air! There after we boarded another connecting flight to Baltimore / Washington International.  It was a snazzy Dash8 32 seater, bumpy, but nice to fly in a prop-driven airplane again.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;a class="photo rite" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;amp;current=PokedSmile.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &amp;gt; Zoomed in"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_tired.jpg" alt="Not tired enough to smile..." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		Chris and Heidi collected us from the airport, and after a little shopping we managed to put our bags down.  Just when we thought we could sit down, Chris had arranged for us to go meet some friends, on our bicycles.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A few hours later my body was in total agony, but my mind was bouncing up and down like an excited toddler, we completed about 30 kilometers that day cruising Rock Creek Park on the bikes.  They have tunnels for bicycles in DC! It was an amazing experience.  We stopped off to get some beers and Gareth's Camera took the timed shot of me trying to pull a smile through the dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;a class="photo cleft" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;amp;current=Trapped.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &amp;gt; Zoomed in"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_deerohdear.jpg" alt="Trapped :(" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		On our return we came accross this poor soul, trapped between a busy road and a fence.  She was panting and shaking, not happy about her circumstances :/  We thought it better to move on as some others tried to herd her back to the park.  I arrived home sweating like a convict on execution day, Washington is VERY humid, worse than Durban I rate.  That night, we had an awesome home-cooked-meal-ala-Heidi-again with good friends.  I remember going to sleep that night feeling satisfied. Gareth, Chris, Chris and Paul went out boozing. :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The next day was a lazy one, the type I could picture doing for the rest of my life.  We all woke up late, then mozied our way through to Chris and Heather's place for a waffle breakfast.  Followed by an entertaining round of Cranium, in which Gareth and Chris were visibly fading.  We left for a few zeds cos that night was gonna be busy :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;a class="photo rite" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;amp;current=TheVenue.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &amp;gt; Zoomed in"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_thevenue.jpg" alt="Our building!" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		Picture it, or just clicky!  Chris G had arranged for us to sit on the roof of this building from 8 onwards...  The clouds were very low, and jumbos lit up the sky coming into land over the Potomac at Reagan International.  The light gradually faded, Arlington burned bright from accross the river and people flooded the boardwalks 8 storeys below us.  A few beers later, it started.  30 minutes of fiercy firey passion, kaleidoscopes of colour.  $250 000 worth of the best fireworks I've ever seen.  It was nothing short of spectacular.  I'm just sorry I don't have any photos to share, they wouldn't do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;a class="photo cleft" href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/?action=view&amp;amp;current=AfterANightOfFire.jpg" title="Browse.to: Photobucket.com &amp;gt; Zoomed in"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/1%20-%20Boston/%20%20%20/thumb_gameover.jpg" alt="A group photo!" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		That pretty much meant we had an excellent evening with good friends.  Time was indeed well spent.  That night, I fell asleep to the same feelings from the night before. 2-0, go happiness!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Monday was a public holiday as a follow on from the 4th. I lazed around while Chris and Gareth did more cycling, and that night we had a delicious meal over at &lt;a href="http://www.gbrowns.com/" title="Follow your nose to: Low Country Cooking, Georgia Browns style."&gt;Georgia Brown's&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Washington.  Chris introduced us to a very nice wine and fried green tomatoes.  This was my birthday time.  The next day, my 25th, we were up early to return to Boston for work. At about 6AM the &lt;acronym title="Short Message Service"&gt;SMS&lt;/acronym&gt;'s started.  Thanks for all the wishes everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Work? Damn.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Work is getting boring, especially after having such a wicked weekend and now getting back to robot work.  I hate not being challenged, well, my patience is being challenged, but still.  If you're not learning anything you should find something else I reckon. I was to do some stuff for BT.com but they're so backwards its scary.  They PAY a company to produce designs for them, pity these numbnuts have no clue on technical standards.  Their designs are uber though.  Check em out at &lt;a href="http://www.agency.com" title="Browse.to.but.come.back: AGENCY.com"&gt;www.agency.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Dorks.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;I'm a patient, all I see are the other bodies in their distant beds and the clinical clerks, expressionless, cold, robotic.  Its a dark and musty ward, the beds are damp with sweat and as unpleasant as the food.  The smell is odourless now, it doesn't change. I don't remember being admitted to this hospital, all I know is that I'm here now and I can't get off this bed.  Every second night, I get cleaned by a nurse. Her features make her unsexy, I can't actually tell if she has features. My brain is numb, my vision milky.  I can't feel my feet.  Theres no TV thank goodness, seeing what the outside is like would br a cruel torture in such a lifeless place, no other patients to talk to, just a restless sleep. Its interrupted by hints of dreams and the cleaning staff. Why do they bother keeping this place clean? It's a thankless task.  There is no music here.  There are no sounds other than the clanging of bed pans, no birds happy outside. Just the odd cry for help or the choking on phlegm. Where is the sun?  Where is the warmth?  Where are the pretty nurses, bosoms the size of their hearts and smiles to wash away any misery?  Maybe they take the nursing jobs worth it...  Everyday I lie here and pity my life. Never did I think of actually doing anything about it.  I'm knee deep in my own apathy and haven't bothered to stand. All I need is that providing and prehistoric spark.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Her name is Michelle. She radiates care, a great listener, even if no-one in the ward can speak.  She makes me want to be better so I can see what she's like outside of this farm for self-pitying fools. She's always prompt.  Even the food she presents just tastes so much better.  In the morning she brings a fresh cup of coffee, that type of coffee that you can smell when you sip it.  Its always the same routine that one can never get bored of, 8AM, shes got a tray of breakfast with that special coffee.  She leaves it at the foot of my bed, just long enough for that aroma to drift towards me, outside of hands-reach.  She motions towards the window and with great finesse opens the blinds and the pane. A fresh breeze, thats her. Every morning I try lift myself up in the bed and pull a smile, a smile through the struggle.  She is my drug, and I'm here till she runs out or I escape myself.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Isolation is...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Gareth left for Switzerland on Wednesday for a week - This place subsequently got a lot lonelier.  I've come to know a few of the edocs people but when you're alone, things get a lot colder.  I can't ever imagine going travelling on my own, unless there was a purpose such as cycling from point to point or making a wad-load of money.  Why is that?  I dream of spending such experiences with someone close.  *sigh*&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I just decided to go for a walk after returning from work, I took my camera along and just walked.  It was 7 in the evening, but the sun still had another 2 or so hours to go.  What an enriching experience to see aliens go about their afternoon lives, raiding the ice-cream stall, sitting on their patios watching the sun go down.  The squirrels went nuts in their trees, birds frolicked on the immaculate lawns of the average Joe and Jane Smith Residences.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After another turn off one of the busier roads I was greeted with a sight to make any pleb jealous.  Houses, No, Estates reeking of wealth, sick with wealth, and just behind our hotel.  I was hoping to find a road or path to connect me back to my hotel, but this road wasn't going anywhere except into lucious suburbs.  So I gathered the nerve to ask some of the well-off-locals and boy, did I get an answer.  The one middle-aged cap-wearing sedan-driving doctor-type made it his personal mission to find out if there was a trail leading through the woods to connect me to the hotel road.  Here he was, in the driveway of his own home, and didn't know if the local surrounding forest had any trails in it.  I bet he had never walked up the road of his own blissville. How sad is that?  I guess thats the difference between a have and a have-not.  Americans take a lot for granted.  I guess South Africans do too, but they're different things we forget and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So after contemplating the worth of it all and avoiding his waffling about how he'd only been there for 6 months I carried on walking.  This was a walk through increasing budgets, house after house the yards got bigger, the cars parked outside got more expensive.  Finally I bumped into some more people and received some decent directions.  I had to walk accross a field fragrant with summer flowers, 50 meters or so in width, the last border between the wilderness and suburbia.  I felt like Maximus, skimming my palms through the wheat, feeling more alive than ever. The trees formed a tunnel, revealing the trail through.  I felt like I was stepping into a new realm.  My dreams of becoming a bandit in this Sherwood forest were shattered when the trees opened up to become a frikkin parking lot.  An empty concrete wasteland of parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I do appreciate the appreciation for nature here, but I can't help but think that man comes selfishly first here. Nature comes a sad second.  Spatterings of reservations, asphalt cleavers splitting the last true residents.  Here on Route 9, 4 lanes of busy New England road, theres a concrete island barrier running most of the length. On the drive back from work one day, I was horrified to see a mother goose and her goslings stranded between the barrier and certain motorised death.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;There are no flies, ants, mosquitos, grasshoppers here. I have no idea what the 3 species of birds feed on. Americans spend about 5 Billion Dollars on pest eradication each year.  (I'm sure you could feed the whole of Africa for that same amount - but that's pointless) I don't know if its climate related or what, but man has taken over here.  A pest in his own right.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;C'est la vie?&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Well, this weekend marks a record week for me.  I billed 63 hours in a week.  Last Saturday, Gareth and I made a point of going out and doing some walking through one of the reservations south of Boston: Blue Hills, outside Milton.  We walked about 3-4 miles of some of the most amazing pine forests in New England.  The half-way mark of the walk was an ancient 3-storey observation tower with a panoramic view of Boston and surroundings.  Awe-inspiring.  The oldest weather station in America was to be found just a stones throw away too.  We saw plenty of squirrels including some curious ground based buggers.  The place is a mountain-bikers heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It was then time to see what the coastal life of southern Boston was like, so we climbed into the hot car and drove towards the atlantic. After a few wrong turns we came accross Marina Bay.  A private and snobby yacht club, masses of Bayliners, this was a miniature Monaco in its own right. So we had a few drinks. (I'm seeing a trend here :D) Thats when the &lt;acronym title="Hallo-Mah-Baby"&gt;HMB&lt;/acronym&gt;'s emerged, prowling for dollars.  Sure, we had a bit to drink already but we both new, these were real chicks!  After oogling for hours, drinking and watching the sun set we decided to brave the car trip back.  Mixing with snobs is hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;When I got back, I crashed.  Work was due for Sunday :/&lt;/p&gt;

			All this time, the push for digital, the push away from legacy.  How about digitising your writing?  I always hear that nothing can replace pen and paper, its just a matter of time before people are using stylus's and tablets.  For meetings, I'm already seeing delegates walking in with their laptops, all wireless enabled.  Star Trek anyone? :D
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;Anyway, I thought it was quite wicked, and a great touch.  Go Microsoft!&lt;/p&gt;

Check the &lt;a href="http://www.wherehaveibeen.com" title="Browse.to: Where Have I Been.com"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; out.  Someone in their infinite bordeom created a site to help cure boredom in others (like me) and track where your money goes.  Nifty!  The last person to register this bill was 166 Miles away from where I got it.  How money driven are we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:left;"&gt;I'm gonna spend it on food.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;A trip into Eccentrica, err, *cough*, Boston&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was a total bum weekend. (sic).  It was the first weekend in a month that we could spend some time in Boston or just lounging around.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So on Saturday Gareth and I organised to go do &lt;a href="http://www.thefreedomtrail.org" title="Browse.to: The Freedom Trail.org"&gt;the Freedom Trail&lt;/a&gt; and see a few sites round Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We drove through to the closest train stop, about 20 miles from our hotel.  The parking lot was PACKED, and after spending 30 minutes and 3.5 dollars queuing we were on the Green-Line 'T' headed for Boston.  The little subway coach was jam-packed with Red Sox supporters on their way to Fenway Park. Imagine that hey?  Getting on a train to go see a sporting event?  The mind boggles.  After dropping the baseball fanatics off at about the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; stop and descending into the subways, we got off 3 stops or so later in Park St. Station.  When we emerged into the sunlight we were greeted with some interesting and downright disgusting sights.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The first thing I saw ascending from the subway was a church steeple (Park St. Church) in the throes of restoration. Imagine heritage, imagine intended rejuvenation, scaffolding and all. Now imagine there are monkeys doing the restoration.  That pretty much sums Boston up, except a high percentage of church go-ers are 'eccentric' and anything but straight.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This weekend is the Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in Boston, so that explained all the 'eccentrics' in the streets.  'Men' holding hands, in G-strings.  How Cute.  In an attempt to get my head clear of the awful images I focused on my juicy hotdog. (err, no wait.)  Yeah, we decided to start the freedom trail.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;2 and half miles of walking along some of the oldest and most significant buildings in Boston's history. &lt;a href="http://www.thefreedomtrail.org/tour.htm" title="Browse.to: The Trail, a virtual tour"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; will give you an idea of what we saw along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, half the exhibits closed at 4PM, so we didn't arrive in time to board the USS Constitution or one of the docked destroyers. It was at about 6PM when we arrived at the Boston Aquarium to see it closed too.  So we had a few beers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We found out that there were some great clubs just down the road from Fenway Park (Home of the Red Sox remember?) and that the Red Sox had just had their asses handed to them on a plate by LA. So we got back on the subway.  After a few more beers in Tiki Room and viewing the non-existent hotties we decided it was time for something to eat.  Just off Massachusetts Avenue was a road of utter class (now if only I could remember the name). Restaurant after Ristorante, reeking of dollars. So like drunken bums we crashed the T.G.I. Friday's and enjoyed a hearty meal. (TGI Fridays is a restaurant / pub chain in America, similar to Keg's.)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Sunday we slept in late.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The people of Boston were always inclined to control their own affairs. It was here, after all, that Puritans first came to establish religious independence [...] It was a good plan, in theory - but Boston colonists were having none of it. They didn't take kindly to the idea that they had no voice, no vote in matters that concerned their essential liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;-- Boston is certainly undergoing another "revolution".  It's not race related, nor is it religious.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For those not-in-the-know, I've uploaded a whole bunch of photos to &lt;a href="http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v236/nDorfin/" title="Browse.to: BotoPhu, err, PhotoBucket.com"&gt;PhotoBucket.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Photobucket automatically compresses each image to 250k or less.  Not great, but not bad either.  I'll upload the pics from Boston soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Long time no update&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;10 days is plenty enough time.  In 10 days nations were conquered, seeds ripened, people change.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Just come back from the local pub, feeling like drunken laddies after a few pints with the mates.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Work has been an all-consuming all-powerful entity in my life, like a drug addiction. Its like my whole life-force is centered around it.  What do you have to show after working so hard? Beside personal vindication and maybe some extra cash in your back pocket you've literally wasted yourslef away doing something seemingly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Whats the difference between and porsche and a porcupine?&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;With a porcupine, the pricks are on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So, I started gymming.  Something I've abhored for many years thinking gym is for jocks and self-centered pricks.  Granted there are many pricks that do gym, but it made me realise just how unfit I really am.  I remember at school PE periods being able to easily do 10 pull-ups and outgunning the rugby tossers who packed on so much weight they could barely do one pull-up.  Now I can barely do one - that will change.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Having Gareth around is great motivation.  We spend about 3 days a week at the local Gold's Gym with our complimentary tickets doing some aerobic and weight training.  I feel like such a weed at times, barely being able to bench-press 20 kilograms in 15 sets.  But then I think about how I was such a n00b at Tribes 2, and that with persistence even the greenest of n00bs can become flybois. :D  This one is for you Jian :)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So, its been focusing on the week, eating well, gymming often and having a positive outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Work has been total crap actually.  I successfully managed to step on the head-UI-developer's toes by suggesting an update to his IDK with my new markup example. Well, I thought I'd never seen pride in the office but this guy was just not interested in any improvements to his little project.  So be it ignoramus - - your loss. Now I'm slaying bugs, a great warrior with shiny silver armour and a maiden to rescue.  Granted, she's a tired old wench but she puts out better than those skanky londonium whores.  Together, Patriot and I have seen the four corners of the earth, stared death in its hollow face and cut his nose off with a giant cleaver.  Fear me.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I'm looking forward to a weekend spent in Boston for the first time since arriving here.  We've sorta planned to go visit &lt;a href="http://www.sixflags.com" title="Browse.to: Six Flags"&gt;Six Flags New England&lt;/a&gt; and maybe go catch a Red Sox game.  The countryside around here is amazing, just pine, spruce and maple forests for as long as the eye can see.  Definately worth a sojourn or two.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;The trip to New York City&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So we decided to go see one of Gareth's friends in Queens, New York, New York.  After 3-4 hours driving we arrived and were toally lost.  New York is HUGE. Gareth's friend Gareth Gareth was drunk when we approached NYC, the very man to give us directions.  I just laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After 1 aand half hours of driving in circles we managed to reach our intended destination, Gareth was getting tense.  I just smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So we had a few beers, and Gareth had a few more.  I was merry enough to still have my wits about me when it was time to leave for a good-nights-sleep.  There we were, 5 of us, limping and laughing back home, feeling tired after a day of work and driving. On our way home we learnt of the quality of street-shopping, as many new yorkers throw stuff out onto the street that is worth quite a bit of tom.  Low and behold, a king-size mattress was on our route, to any half-drunk person yearning for a few zees it was manna from heaven.  But there had to be a reason it was out on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The next morning we woke to tea, cereal and an itenerary any newcomer to new york would plan. We took the subway to Grand Central station and amazed ourselves under the huge dome.  Truly grand.  I spent about 10 minutes in a sports-store (10 minutes is a lot for a man in any store) looking for a hockey jersey for Neill (oops, did I mention Neill? My bad! :D) From there we walked through to Times Square and some jaw-dropping times.  Times Square is amazing, the hub of New York, its almagamtion of culture and melting pot of races.  After a few photos and seeing the steaming cup of noodles we walked up to the Empire State Building.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;An hour spent in queues is quite good for the Empire State Building.  It was an overcast day, but our fears of poor visibility were put aside when we reached the top to see a panaroma of concrete and steel. Visibility was 15 miles, enough to see all the rivers on all sides and the many bridges that spanned them.  No cent is spared in America when it comes to hurdling an obstacle such as a 200m wide river.  After many happy snaps and feeling like a total tourist we left for an epic pub-crawling-adventure the likes of which I'd never imagined.  In the end we were stopping off at pubs just to take a leak and therefore have another beer.  I felt like one of the manne.  After a stop-off at one of the more dodgy strip-clubs and walking for miles to get something to eat our journey truly ended when we met up with the girls and a few other mates to go have an evening in the Gotham Comedy Club.  A select set of comedians were presnting a stand-up dig in front of a select group of people, and we were invited.  For some reason, these guys and gals were actually funny! (This week, I noticed 2 of the comedians on TV - these are not small time comics). We lef the show with sore stomach muscles and grins imprinted on our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After sleeping in a bit the next morning, overcoming the tenderness perpetrated by a drinking hang-over, we set off for Paragon Sports, the biggest sports store I've ever seen. (A recurring theme here folks, everything here in the States is just bigger and better than anywhere else).  Gareth bought some fancy new climbing boots for his trip to the Andes at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On our return joruney we stopped off at a Denny's and finally had a semi-decent restaurant meal.  Avoid McDonalds and Burger King - nasty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;10 days later?&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Gareth is still scratching at his bed-bug-bites from that infested mattress.  Theres a lesson here: If someone throws a mattress onto the street in New York, and in your drunken state you want to use it, forget it.  Gareth looks like he's got hives its so bad.  I still laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Till the next update. I'm so tired I'm squinting.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A traveller.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Feet blistered from many a mile, face scorched from sunshine.  To know the road is to know yourself.  Out here in the blistering heat you only have your own mind to talk to, its like a drunken brawl trying to persuade your psyche to wake up and see the tar for what it is, black, lifeless, something beneath your feet. Yet you plod on, left right, links regs.  The travelling is not about the pacing towards the end of the road, its about seeing everything on the way and learning about it.  Learning more about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The weather can be harsh, or pleasant.  The road can be steep, or flat.  (Steep represents downhill too.)  Each step is a step forward, a journey each one of us should take, often neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;An oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareth: Washington DC is out-of-control and fucking rocks man - put that in! :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Uncle George's place&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Gareth and I took a drive down to Wsahington DC early on saturday morning.  It took us 8 hours to drive 666 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We passed through such amazing cities as New York, Newark, Baltimore, Philedelphia.  New York is a lot bigger than you think.  From the Bronx, we took the I-95S around the northern parts of New York and saw the manhattan skyline on the horizon, on a beautiful spring day.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mind blowing size, bulging budgets and a great appreciation for rock.  America is the home of rock, you flip thru radio channels and are greeted with the sweet tones of Led Zeppelin, Blue Oyster Cult, Lost Prophets, Metallica.  If there was another reason for me to move to the US, it would be for the music.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The american road driving experience is an interesting one, especially when you get pulled over by a sweaty-state-police-pig after doing 83 in a 65 zone.  $180 is way too much apparently.  Phew.  But that set a tone for the driving, chilled 75 miles an hour with everyone else on the road.  At most of the overhanging bridges american flags flapped againt the railings, multitudes of flags of all sizes.  Trucks keep up to the speed limit and everyone just cruises along, as if all attached by cables.  I have never seen so many different types of cars before, all burning clean fuel with little or no visible emissions.  Trucks the sizes of football fields, shining chrome in immaculate condition.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;In the prideland&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Our timing couldn't have been better.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It was memorial day weekend.  A time to remmeber fallen soldiers fighting for america's right to have war when they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It was also &lt;acronym title="Harley Owners Group"&gt;HOG&lt;/acronym&gt; weekend, close to 10 000 Harley Davidsons were in Washington, as many veterans pursue the passion of comradery on their steel horses. "Rolling Thunder" is really the only phrase to descibe a thousand harleys dragging up the main streets in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Every year, around this time of the year the indigenous cicadas emerge from 17 years of slumber and pupation.  In an eerie forest born chorus they entice mates and intrigue the locals.  While it does remind you a lot of the bush in SA, it seems as foregin as this country is.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Bliss, this is.&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Our hosts, Chris and Heidi are an amazing couple.  Heidi is a part-swiss-part-barbadian-all-american-economist and Chris is a cardiologist with a great appreciation for life.  They recently moved into a beautiful apartment in a "transition-neighbourhood" in north western washington.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We arrived at about 4PM, so Chris decided we should walk through the Rock Creek Park which literally divides Washington DC in half.  It was mind-blowing walking through an all-nautral forest in the middle of a huge city.  We finished off our walk with a beers in Georgetown, then stumbled down to the Potomac river to see Virginia, some of the local wild-life (SA girls still rock) then caught a cab back to Heidi's and Chris' place. When we arrived, Heidi had been preparing a wonderful meal.  Tilapia, served with a white-wine, brown-sugar and garlic topping with a side of nutty-greco salad.  Such an awesome meal topped off with hot apple pie and melting ice-cream.  I was literally dozing off, but the old farts had enough steam to go out partying till 3AM, visiting a jazz club and knocking back a few bourbons and &lt;acronym title="Gin and Tonics"&gt;G&amp;amp;T's&lt;/acronym&gt; for $6 each.  I fell asleep to honking hispanics and birds chirping in the faux-day provided by the street lights.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The next morning we cycled everywhere!  Chris took us for sojourns through the Mall area of Washington, we saw all the memorials we could, visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt memorial which left us totally gob-smacked.  We spent about 3 hours totally oogling at the Natural History Museum and grabbing a bite to eat.  Then we went to an olde american restaurant called the Chophouse and Brewery and had some home-brewed dark ales.  When we got back home, Heidi had been industrios in the kitchen again.  I felt guilty for some reason, Heidi went through a lot of trouble to accommodate us and our stomachs.  Kudos!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Chris has an awesome taste in music, so while chillin' to some kewl tunes and flipping thru photos it was soon time for bed again.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we were back on our bikes again and headed down to the Botanic Gardens.  There was another veterans parade, consisting of few authentic jeeps, bikes, &lt;acronym title="Armored Personnel Carriers"&gt;APC's&lt;/acronym&gt; and even amphibious vehicles.  The botanical gardens were mind-blowing.  All the plants were flowering with health, so much so, we spent about half-an-hour in the Orchid area. It doesn't get better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Back to Boston&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We're now on our way back to Boston stuck in traffic after the long weekend yet revelling in the awesome times we had over the last 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Chris and Heidi are so in love it was beautiful.  Adoration in the eyes, respect in the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Americans are truly patriotic, almost bordering on fundamentalism.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Frankling D. Roosevelt was and is an amazing man.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Washington was a lot less clinical than I thought it would be.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Gareth has some amazing friends.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting there&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, a much needed update.  I'll try seperate it where possible.  Downloading T2 in the background to play on my flashy new edocs supplied laptop :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8000ish miles to go....&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to South Africa, or rather, you'll remember us when you're gone, if you can get out. In typical South African fashion inefficiency reeks in the customs department.  I queued for 30 mins after checking in baggage, sorry for you if you're slightly late.  8 cubicles manned by one seriously old man and 2 women.  The international visitors now departing our wonderfully useless country are left with a bitter taste in their mouths.  We waited in the business class lounge just long enough to finish a free beer or two and chat to the other snobs.  Anyway, that was all before 7PM on thursday night (20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;).  After the last boarding queue, we had to step outside and get on a bus.  The bus waited for a good 5 minutes before we almost collapsed from breathing in too much diesel.  The cranky internationals were now getting vocal about the bad service.  Gareth and I just grinned and beared it like South Africans I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was that, we turned our backs on Jozy and boarded the shiny new SAA Airbus A340 600.  This plane was the shit!  Naturally it was 100 times better in business class.  The seats were incredibly comfortable even after 11 hours of flying.  Theres a retractable and adjustable light just above your right shoulder.  A 13" monitor folds neatly out of your right armrest.  On the left you've got your tray which folds into the armrest too, and the controls for the chairs just below it.  Yes, electric motors to adjust your seat.  I felt like a true rich bastid.  After take off, one of the Air Stewarts (Not stewards, Gareth and I joked about how all the male flight attendants are queens) or flight attendants come by, set up your tray table with a table cloth, pass you a heated towel (what the hell?) and ask you what you want for supper.  Gareth ordered the merlot and the cute air-hostess that served him.  I had the seasonal salad and skipped on the air-hostess.  She was all bitchy and stuff. I ordered the fillet and a few beers, oh my, melt-in-the-mouth beef, garlic rolls and good beer.  Once supper was trying to settle it was DVD time!  Mystic River, Along Came Polly to name a few and on the circuit they had Frasier (amongst others) which was good.  Next thing I know Gareth has passed out from too much wine and I'm fading fast too.  Didn't sleep well but within no time we were greeted with a traditional south african breakfast followed by our descent into Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What am I doing here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just state categorically that Frankfurt is a terrible airport.  Imagine a socialist / industrialist setting, 70's style abuse of metal with no taste for interiors, whiffs of cigarette smoke on the fan.  For 4 hours we abused the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge's coffee supply and biscuits.  German males are an interesting crossbreed of up-and-coming east-randers and intellectual businessmen. Women, like the men. (harsh? :D) Paging thru german magazines is like reading a user-manual for a complicated household appliance. Lets just say, its 4 hours of my life spent in total fascination in the clothing styles of the germans, daziness and that feeling you're sleeping with your eyes open.  Now, boarding was a breeze.  South Africa, take note, they might have bad taste, but they're orderly.  They even have automated toilet seat cleaners. Pity about the US customs, removing shoes, getting felt up by the sweaty german guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Following Columbus, sorta.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we boarded a Lufthansa Airbus A340 200, an older model, with older decor.  Gareth and I agreed that business class on that flight was like economy class on SAA.  (Hmm, maybe we are becoming snobs - All it takes is one flight in business class and everything else pales in comparison)  At this stage I've got a sore stomach from being so lethargic for the last 15 hours.  Not pleasant.  At least our air hostess was more accommodating. The food was better.  8 hours later and we touched down to a beautiful spring day in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The U.S. of A, after a day.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filling out all the paperwork, being interviewed again and fingerprinted we were in the US!  Avis sent a bus over to come pick us up.  (I'm still trying to get used to their weird sense of styles in motor vehicles.)  After arguing with their sales rep and watching Gareth's credit card bounce we finally picked up a Ford Freestar "mini-van" (pretty similar to a Chrysler Voyager) and tried to navigate the maze of highways and routes out of Logan Internationl into Natick. All I can say is WOW.  I've never seen so many leafy green maples in my life before.  The Boston Reseroirs are all full, giving the area a calm lake district feel.  There are no flies or gnats, plenty of sparrows and crows and these amazing trees.  Drunken with fatigue we actually made it thru to the offices there and introduced ourselves around (nuts?).  On the way home we picked up some pre-paid sim cards from T-Mobile (bad choice in the end, we have to pay for all incoming calls and the coverage is useless! Americans are so backwards when it comes to cellphones)  Then we actually made it thru to the &lt;a href="http://www.sierrasuites.com/locations/westborough.asp" title="Browse.to: Sierra Suites Westborough"&gt;suites in Westborough&lt;/a&gt;.  Boston to Natick: 50 miles.  Natick to Westboroguh: 10 miles. It felt far too long. I unpacked and crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The first saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up about 4 times during the night and then got up at about 9.  We did some much needed shopping.  Um, food?  We stopped by a um, Super Stop &amp;amp; Shop, similar to a Pick and Pay.  The first isle was whacked.  We found muesli and soups and stuff, but my word it was expensive.  We frowned upon the lack of cereals.  Then we found the other isles. FOOD!  They had one isle dedicated to cereals.  Heart Attack flavour, High Cholestorol flavour, Guilt with a smile flavour.  My word, FOOOOOOD!  Interestingly enough, all the healthy stuff was like double the price, wholewheat bread is like rye bread and twice the price of white bread.  If the american government wanted to cure obesity, I reckon they should tax all the bad-for-you stuff and lift the taxes on the good-for-you stuff. :D  After buying some authentic american ice cream and the usual stuff we were out of there. It takes a while to get used to driving in the USA, especially if there are no cars around.  Gareth almost slipped up once, driving down the wrong side of the road.  Then got a chance to catch up on more sleep and check what the suites had to offer.  Kitchenette, bathroom, couch and double bed each.  What more could a bachelor want? Oh, wireless internet access, room service and a TV thats what. Saturday's supper was spent at a local friendlies, a kiddies restaurant.  Don't ask. :D  The best chocolate shake I've ever tasted and a toasted chicken sandwich from hell, it rocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleepy Sunday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was true &lt;acronym title="Rest and Relaxation"&gt;R&amp;amp;R&lt;/acronym&gt;, lazing around, reading, watching TV.  That evening we took a walk thru to the local pub and learnt that baseball is an OK game, and not all americans are rude and arrogant. :P  Their beers suck though.  We'll make plans to go check out the Redsox kick more ass sometime.  Ice Hockey and Football are not happening round this time of the year, so we won't be able to see them in action.  Dunno about Basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to Corporate America.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Office space" and "Dead like me" come to mind when describing edocs' offices.  Cubicles, water machines, some irriating types, but wait, they have FREE vending machines with snacks and sodas.  Sekz!  They have this weird coffee machine that you put a special filter cup into place and it sorts you out.  edocs had arranged two brand spanking new Dell Latitude D600's for gareth and I, with everything installed.  Efficiency!  Everything just works here, no failed traffic lights, bad networking etc.  Wireless pwns, No hassles networking. Anyway, Gareth and I are gonna be working on a dog-ugly project, fixing bugs and adding improvements where possible.  Home from home :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the usual&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its now the end of day 4, and we're settling into a routine.  I've arranged with Gareth to go to the local gym and work on a fitness reginme. 2 months is more than enough time to see results, especially with such a motivated fitness fanatic watching my progress.  Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try arrange a rental mountain bike and investigate the local woodlands with my awesome little camera. Anton should hopefully be setting up the Consology Vhost for me, so I can stick up a whole lot of photos soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandwidth Sponsored by Wayport Cable (135k/s to SA, 5ms ping to first hop - can't wait to give T2 a shot on this spiffy new laptop!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;nD&lt;/p&gt;

    <title></title>
    <content>
    &lt;h3&gt;It's been a while (Staind say it best)&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So the laptop is well, on my lap again and the CD is making a hectic buzz, its like a vibrator *hubba hubba*.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Just came back from an awesome supper with our resident grey-kop, Katarn.  Time spent with a friend is time well spent.  Katarn and I can talk about some of the deepest shit around which is quite refreshing.  And we weren't even stoned. :)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In chatting about blogging, it got me thinking as to why I started blogging in the first place.  I admit, its nice being talked about or being passed compliments, but the thing driving me the most to blog was a feeling of experimentation.  To explore avenues in myself and others.  Its been good.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So I've been told that a lot of of the stuff I write about comes accross as being feminine.  I think our fairer sex still has a lot to teach us guys, when you think of compassion, which sex do you think of?  When you think of greed, or arrogance, which sex do you think of?  Off the cuff, I'm not gay.  (So shoo Anthrax!) :D  But as a free thinking person, I think there is much value in trying not to be such a man.  I'm an emotional person, why should I reserve something so intricate?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;OK, now this vibrating laptop is getting frikkin irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I found interesting recently and totally agree with, is that your best work is when you just do something cos you're passionate about it. Pay someone to do something and it just won't be the same, it'll be forced, passionless.  Look at artists and authors.  I reckon some artists create their best pieces when they're broke-ass or depressed.  Say you'll pay them for their next piece and it just won't be the same person behind the brush.  When last did you do somnething totally selfless?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between madness and eccentricity is the size of the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Wholeness vs Holeness&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I've been told before that searching for a relationship to make you complete is unhealthy and the wrong attitude towards a relationship.  Take the circle analogy.  You want to be a complete circle.  You're half a circle.  You want your other half to become whole.  Thats bad right?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I got a different perspective to this analogy from a very special neighbour while she was on an exchange program in France.  She reckons rather you should be a complete circle yourself first.  You're a small circle, but you're still complete.  When you meet this other small full circle, you create a bigger circle, like two bubbles in a soapy mingling, you become one another and something more.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;But now I don't know.  I know I'm at my most happy when I make others happy.  They do complete me first.  I'm a goat.  If I'm not satisfying my soulmate, I'm just not satisfied.  Maybe I am half a circle, yearning to be more complete, but when the two halves meet, we become more than what two halves create.  Its the space between that expands inside us, like a mixing of gases with an explosive reaction, with us shielding it, absorbing it.  I think you're truly whole when you know how to love.  Whats wrong with wanting someone to complete you?  What greater sacrifice that offering yourself to someone else completely?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je suis a toi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;Update on the travel plans&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Thursday, 7pm.  Finally, a date and a time to plan my life around.  Gareth and I'll be flying business class to Frankfurt and then Boston in a marathon 19 hours over 8500 miles.  Business class, I believe, is the shiznit!  We'll be flying SAA in the new Airbus A340's.  This my friends, is as good as it gets.  Did I mention I'm stoked? :D&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;We'll be staying in the Sierra Suites in Westborough, MA.  At $80 a night with breakfast included, its amazing too see just how insignificant the rand and my thoughts on spending are.  The plane tickets are gonna cost $5k, return.  We get a car for our uses.  Words fail me, literally?  My gut reaction right now, is to work my ass off and make it totally worth edocs and consology's time and money.  And have a great time doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Gareth has plans to drink lots, meet plenty of people, hike Vermont flat, visit New York.  I have plans to tag along as much as possible :D  Other than that, see all those things you never get a chance to, such as going to see Linkin Park, KoRn, Incubus, tour Harvard and walk Boston flat.  Part of me wants to sit down with an american over coffee and just talk. (I hope she'll be cute :D)  See what life is like on the other side.  *conjures up plans to ask out someone within edocs*  *plans crushed*  *conjures up just going to stacks of clubs and pubs* *smiles*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Into the hands of fate&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Getting into the US has changed a lot since last I went.  Now, VISA applications have a mandatory interview session.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Your application has to include:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Your current employer's letter of appointment&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;A letter from your contractor in the US explaining why you're needed in the US&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;6 months worth of payslips&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;3 months worth of bank statements&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Any lease information with regards to your current residence&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;3 2"x2" colour photos&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;... and R720&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Dare I say: Penis measurements?  Who knows what happens in these sessions!&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;At first, the only available interview appointment date was the 7th of June.  People die and get buried in under a weeks time, yet to book an interview is going to take 3 weeks?!  Talk about beareaucracy!  Its all artificial security IMO.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I've been trying to apply for internet banking.  4 days later, it might actually work.  I've faxed branches with updated personal details, shown them my new ID number, phoned their call center 3 times.  Wow.  Customer Service in this country rocks, but we all know that already.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;In other news...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Looks like &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com" title="Browse.to: Blogger.com"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; are really pulling up their socks.  Rock on adaptive path! Guess I should finally put more work into my blogspot blog.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;This entry dedicated to...&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;...someone you don't know.  You rock poo.  I posted about wholesome people, wondering where they are, and there she is, right under my nose. (She is kinda short :P)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want the best for her, I want to see her excell, I want her to smile.  Oh boy can she smile, she makes me tickle inside :)  She is natural, beautifully timid like a wild deer.  I think she's trapped in her mind though, and it hurts me to see her that way.  I want to take a can opener and peel away the now hardened tin shell, exposing the wonderfulness inside.  I know its there, there are hints.  She goes thru life, saying shes happy, but I know she hurts.  I want to comfort her.  I want to be her bastion of security.  Open your eyes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Now its eating me up that I have to leave her nameless.  I'd happily tell the world how much I love her, but thats not fair on her.  I don't think she feels the same way about me.   I've always gone thru life like that, totally devoted to someone who wouldn't even think the same about me.  I think its great, but it hurts at times.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Anyway, did some reading into chinese astrology. Turns out I'm a goat.  After reading the description I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fits me.  A cancerian goat.  A cancerian goat moon child.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I wish I was the sk8r boi, but I don't want Avril Lavigne, she's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;My place of serenity is only a place that I know of.  Its an aura of love, love from the earth itself.  I feel complete in the speckled shadows of its life-giving branches.  When I run through the shadows, the sun flashes between the leaves, in that moment, I am alive. All around, there is a glow of peace, fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;I could play in the tree all day, swinging from overhangs upside down and never fear falling, cos here you just float.  At night you can lie in the bows, head resting against the trunk and listen to the marsupial folk go about their nocturnal playfulness.  You don't need sleep here cos you're constantly dreaming.  Sometimes it feels like this is the only tree in the jungle and I wonder if my tree is lonely.  With a trunk so strong and leaves bristling with vitality its evident that all is well.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Everyday our two trees move closer together.  The branches reach out to the sun, and one another.  Two steeples of security, with arms encircling.  I play in my tree, you in yours.  We don't notice the closing of the distance.  Our trees see the value in that closeness, yet we're too distracted feeling gees swinging from the branches.  For the first time, our eyes cross.  You're shy yet playful.  I'm totally curious.  I chase you thru the branches, you enjoy the attention.  Pretty soon, I'm not even in my own tree anymore.  But my tree is not mine, its ours.  I'm clambering up what used to be yours.  Its great, I'm beaming from ear to ear!  The trees are smiling too, because in this moment, everything is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I'm.so.excited.right.now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat your hearts out, I'm gonna be as far away from the 3rd world as I am a socialite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, 3 whole frikkin months in Boston, MA, on a skills exchange of sorts. Starting within the week. Our tech partner &lt;a href="http://www.edocs.com" title="Browse.to: edocs.com"&gt;eDocs&lt;/a&gt; has requested 2 of us from the office, and specifically mentioned my name! I've got to teach a few of them Web Standards, Markup, CSS, while they train the two of us in some new products and J2EE Struts / Tiles. I can't wait :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (Gareth - total party machine) are set to leave on the 17th. We'll have a car with unlimited mileage at our disposal, and a company rented house in an upmarket suburb, 5 miles from edoc's head office in Natick. Travel Subsidy and the usual SA salary. \o/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkin Park, Incubus, Jewel, Sarah Maclachlan, Dave Matthews Band are all going to be performing in the greater Boston area over the time period. Rock on, its gonna be such an awesome experience moshing with americans. I'm also making plans to visit the Tribal Wars LAN in virginia and play tribes with some of the best players in the world. Be very jealous right now fellow gamer. :) I'll just have to buy a new Area51m Laptop from &lt;a href="http://www.alienware.com" title="Browse.to: Alienware.com"&gt;Alienware&lt;/a&gt; first :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I'm trying to organise my whole life around this thing - phew. Visas, Banking, Tax, International drivers license, the question of renting, My car, clothes shopping, eish, its all catching up with me. Most of that all comes second to working overseas for 3 WHOLE MONTHS! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whose gonna tell me those things?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Whose gonna walk across the field with me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;sorry..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ok... it is ok.... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;sorry just temporary malfunction here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;everything is fine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;just a fuse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I like that "walk accross the field"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;build on it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Go with it babes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;tell me more about the walking accross the field!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;please!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ok.....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;um there is a field&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and we is like walking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;tell me about the grass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;it is green and lush.....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;glowing with health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;with some dew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;smells fresh like a day full with opportunities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;what happens when you lift your feet?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;wow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(*snigger*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the grass is gentle like a cushion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;where is the sun?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;so u can only have delicate steps accross it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in my face.... distorting my vision that i can only hear the person next to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;their laughter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;hoping they're laughing at my jokes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;but in that moment you dont really care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;nope i don't&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;cos its a beautiful day, there is life all around&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;and you're with someone you trust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;someone who will laugh at your jokes, or just laugh at how cute you are when you try make him/her laugh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;cos the warmth of the sun is on my cheeks and everyone is giddy with laughter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Oops?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created an offline journal entry and was meant to upload it, but I think it was subconciously deleted. And I can't figure out if thats bad or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, went thru a total bender recently. Looks like I got some solid sleep last night which is helping da mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye and thanks for all the fish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Emptiness is&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laptop, on top of my lap, 1:22 hours remaining battery, but thats OK, Hybrid Theory is not a long album. Pity that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling so empty lately. Unfulfilled. I think its cos I've been too much of a hermit recently. Go to work, work, go to home, lounge. No exercise, I feel like I'm falling apart. I don't think I've been out for close on a month. Sheesh. Anyway, had some good chats to my fellow capper and shrike jockey Mburr. There need to be more mburrs in the world we know. He's a Paladin in an evil world, battling with those who can't see the value in his faith, battling with evil, battling with himself. And I agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any value in morals these days? I get the idea that morals are failing in the world. How many people do you know that would shag without loving? To fuck is to be thoghtless, emotionless. Damn all you types who abuse something so magical as sex. How dare you take it for granted. AIDS is there to remove you from the face of my planet, get off now please. Sex is the ultimate expression of your love for someone, if you don't love them, you don't deserve it. Plain and simple. To shag is to be a base primate, without thoughtlessness. You're fulfilling a primeval instinct, common in jocks. We've been gifted with thoughtfulness, what better mental and emotional experience to be that close to someone you truly love. Show her just how much you love her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is my horse too high if I think like that? Does anyone else thik like that?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no perfect partner, just a perfect couple.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Karl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm too involved in finding the perfect partner, yet I don't even bother looking. I've been cruising ICQ, meeting new people from all over the world, getting different opinions and tastes for life. (Hi Fatima, Fabiana! :D) But I don't even bother meeting new people I can actually see. Work has been a god-send with regards to meeting new people, but its all too professional. I'm happy at work though, I get on well with everyone which is great, but still. With so many other guys my age, and gamers, we don't really create chances to meet new people outside of the gaming social circle. Part of me just wants to avoid that whole scene, partly cos I think its all so false. Its the alcohol talking. Am I wrong? Where have all the wholesome people gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I felt like I was thinking out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you love someone who's afraid of commitment? With a sore-heart. Fuck it hurts. Is all this worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So reader, what would you do to meet wholesome people? You know, the salt-of-the-earth types, the ones digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm stuck in a sea of people, clawing my way to the surface. I can see all the other heads bobbing in the waves, just their foreheads. They don't even want to breath. SOMEONE HELP THESE PEOPLE! I can't save all these helpless souls by myself and I'm cross with myself because of it. Suddenly the sharp realisation hits me with a dull thud, thor's hammer: they don't want to be saved, they like their obscured vision beneath the miniscus created on their faces. They like the asphyxiation, they're all cheap druggies. If they chose to drown, should I pull them out? Is it selfish of me to think like that? FUCK, I can't let this continue. I pull the closest head out the water, but the stare is vacant, this is not a person. Suddenly I'm pinned under a few of the zombies, they're trying to pull me under. I resist, cos I have to. Everything I stand for, exists in the air above. In a great explosion of zealous power, I erupt from below, shooting out the water like a freak spout of divine energy. Blinded by the light, the mindless ones cower in sheer fear, there fixations are replaced with cold-hard-reality. They didn't think it possible, no one can escape. But I'm free. Free of all that conciouslessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 45 minutes left eh? Bugger that, I'm off to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Are the weekends over yet?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sibleh, All these public holidays are disruptive. While I enjoy not having to do much, it means there are more mondays in the week. "/ Mondays as they say, are a crap way to spend one seventh of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is man god's blunder, or is god man's blunder?&lt;br /&gt;--Friedrich Nietchze&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the holy quest for extrovertedness, I've picked up a nasty inclination towards total arrogance, selfishness. Empathy *is* an introverted emotion. I hurt Carla's feelings and I didn't even think twice about it. There is much value in just listening and not talking your kop off. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A closed mouth gathers no feet"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck this soap opera that is Tribes. There is so much bad blood everywhere, it must look like a 3rd world slaughter house. Is it possible to start anew? I'd like to think so, but there will always be this obscured vision. Its so petty too, we had a great thing once, now its all fucked. Is that the price for going to far with the community spirit? Should there be a layer of anonymity (sp?) instead of getting too personal? The day I think things changed was when people didn't care anymore. Training stopped, people didn't post interesting news on the forums. We got involved in competition for Team ZA, people played to win. Playing to win is great, but then everyone else must play to win and not whine about being thrashed. Winning is fun. CHKNHD left. Downhill from there. Attitudes veered off the road like taxi drivers over christmas. Last straw: Cheating. Such a great community down the tubes. Another problem Tribes had was lack of critical mass. (x amount of players per night, we were x-10.) We have a golden opportunity with Tribes Vengeance to get critical mass. HL2 is delayed. Roll on Vengeance. Will our community spirit be back with a vengeance though? *cough*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open page, blank, a portal to the void. Your pen, a great lightsabre in the dark. When the two meet, the void seems a little less empty, the darkness brightens. Spiderwebbing over the portal door, shielding you from the lack of feeling. There is human essence in that ink, it burns into the page, yet is cold to the touch. Patterns in the portal door. Thoughts. Emotions. Bring it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wish I was a bird *tweet*.&lt;br /&gt;
Flying on the wind, how sweet.&lt;br /&gt;
Devouring ripe fruit, till I'm fat&lt;br /&gt;
What could be better than that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Meet my mate, she's so great&lt;br /&gt;
Songs will bind us like fate.&lt;br /&gt;
We'd move to an upmarket suburb&lt;br /&gt;
... one with a recent refurb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There we'd build a few nests,&lt;br /&gt;
one in which to invite guests.&lt;br /&gt;
Then we'd bring up some chicks,&lt;br /&gt;
oh to hear their little "clicks"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a fulfilling life,&lt;br /&gt;
and spending it with my wife,&lt;br /&gt;
I'd die happy and fat...&lt;br /&gt;
What could be better than that!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Marooned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a wind's whim we take a starboard tack, we're a drifer mostly.  On board, a mindless captain, parched from the sun and a salty diet of fish.  Beneath the decks, a lone prisoner, camouflaged within the steel bars of his jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is sure aboard this ship, the prisoner yearns to feel the warmth of the sun on his pale skin.  To grab the wheel and steer the wandering vessel on a course anew.  It eats at him everyday, like the barnacles covering the bow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this is a ship of fools, a witless slave of virtue, a witless slave to the vessel.  Captain and prisoner alike.  They are one and the same. The sails work, but they have no rope to harness their power.  The rudder flaps in the current like a child sitting on the edge of a pool, splashing his feet in the water.  The wheel responds like a disillusioned hamster, not knowing which way to run his own wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the captain waste his time on fishing all day when he could be sailing the seas for new land, land of plenties, land of beauties.  Why doesn't the prisoner escape.  To swim is to be free.  This boat has all the makings of a story-telling-ship, yet it cruises through laziness like a sloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drifter we have been, a drifter we shall be.  Where are those trade-winds.  Where is the sun to guide me to terra firma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I? Who am I!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;MMORPGGoodbye...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this a last will and testament, with all the &lt;acronym title="Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/acronym&gt; madness I've been involved in, I don't think I need to hang around here anymore...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can't business life be as interesting as an MMORPG? *sigh* Then I'd WANT to climb the corporate rungs, oust the CEO and run the company like a dictator...    I'd slay my enemies, loot their corpses and their legacies.  I'd slap up any peasant who would dare question my judgement and find the most beautiful woman ever to marry. *snap*  She better be tall, clever and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We interrupt this broadcast...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, its life as normal (Normal: A setting on a hairdryer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw "Second-hand Lions" yesterday, very entertaining.  Haley Jole-Osmont (or whatever) is visibly aging, maybe I'm getting old too.  I want a life like his great-uncle in the movie, played by Robert Duval. Kill bad guys, have enough money to never worry about anything and fall in love with a princess. *siiiiigh*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In technical news, I found a FireFox extension called Deepest Sender, which allows me to update my LJ from the browser using an RSS plugin.  Nifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cleavage?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats the point anyway?  Now the ladies have to show a bit more flesh for a day?  Sure, its sekzy and stuff, but another

capitalist plot like christmas.  Maybe I'm just bitter cos I didn't see any cleavage today :P &amp;lt;/perv&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Archive THIS!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd stick some old stuff I wrote a while back in here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who do i turn to?  Who can I say loves me?  Who can I say I love?
who dares take me for what I am?  I cant even turn to my own mother for that.  why?  cos that person who DEMANDS my love.
Who will take me in under their wing, show me affection, hold me tight?  Whisper in my ear, drive me crazy.
Who can I call someone significant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is willing to take that leap of faith, see me for who I am underneath it all?  Anyone can I guess, i just have to lower my

shields.  Once inside, you're safe too.  My security is your security.  My faith is your love.  My trust is your sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the dangers shielded, we can get on with knowing each other to the core, to the very essence that defines us as human beings.

 CONCIOUSNESS.  KNOWING WE'RE CONCIOUS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving is powerful.  its the harbour shielding the vessels from the great blue harm.  its the promise of rain after a dry
summer.  you give me something that makes me wish it was more.  makes me wish it was more than just a friendship thing, makes me

wish it was that way.  while i do value what we have, i want more.  I want you.  I want to love you and you love me back.  Is that

too much?  Im sick of second guessing myself, i want to open myself up to you, share my thoughts, passion.  i want you to open up to

me too, tell me what scares you so that I may comfort you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im locked up, no key to the door. the prison is somewhere in the expanse between friendship and love.  the gatewarden

is a selfish prick.  Im not allowed to see the sun, feel its warmth on my white skin.  I cant even look twice at the female inmates.

 when i shower, its got to be to stay clean, not relax.  i'm not allowed to enjoy it, cos its cold outside and the water is colder,

they must run it thru a fridge first, just to spite the inmates and laugh at their shrinking dicks.
the other inmates dont seem to notice where they are, why they got there, or even bother to think of a way to get out.  the prison

is located on a great spire, it stretches too high for a man to survive a fall into the warm waters below.  we know its warm cos it

cant be as cold as it is in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then she walks past my cage.  the sun shines indoors for her.  she looks my way the way she does everyday and waves hello.  its

torment, how can she be so kind in a place so cold?  can't she see im hurting?  does she know she's even here?  IS SHE HERE?  She

brings both grief and happiness to my world, like the taste of sweet liquer, it feels great but removes my conciousness, my

self-control.  my self worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, she's waving to the next inmate too!  How can she!  She's meant to wave to me only!  HOW CRUEL!
I cant tell her that shes my everything.  Thats unfair right?  I think its unfair to bottle up something so beautiful.  I dont care

really how she's feel about it.  Knowing someone out there feels that way about me would be a KICKASS feeling!  But what if I didnt

like them?  Ouch.  needle pinches as it enters.  It delivers its payload and Im subdued again.  fuck these drugs.  You cant go to

rehab for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to jump from the prison windows.  I would live for the rush, knowing ive escaped.  I would die in the hands of the

warmth.  I would die happy.  I want her to jump with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take you in my hands, you fit snug, more snug than my own hand.  it feels good.  nothing can replace that feeling,

that your sense of touch is provoked, aroused by someone else.  no longer is it you sending a echoing relay of impulse, but an

external source reaching out for reciprocation.  I stroke, ploughing your fertile earth with sharp steel.  the earth is turned over,

rejuvenated.  then you touch me back, it sparks my internal engine into life.  goddamn, this sounds too pornoish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here we all are, mulling on, again.  I look at my hands, my tendons and veins show from below.  when they look so

scaly, so boney, does that mean they are not capable of love.  i had such a vivid dream, there we were, out in the open, free

countryside, just her and I.  i liked her.  it was the kissing, nothing more, except that closeness.  it wasnt about sex, it wasnt

about the prelude to sex, it was just that moment.  my lips mingled with hers.  i feel her breathe inside me and i in her.  we are

at our most honest.  im totally focused on her, giving her my all.  then he comes along, and wants to chase us out of the potato

plantation.  its not even his frikkin plantation.  he was watching us as well.  what a freak!.
but i think back about the closeness, and its all worth it.  i ignore him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ahh, to retire, young.  i dream of leather sandals, bicycle, italian villa, fresh bread.  open breezy shirt, shorts,

sunglasses and a good book.  similar aged soulmate, tall, independent, free-thinking, and just slightly busty :P  the smell of fresh

ground coffee in a filter, lazy sun stretching its beam thru the open shutters.  no other sound but the water carelessly scraping

the rocks down below.  the wind, moving softly thru the trees, leaves falling, green leaves.  she comes to me, on the porch

overlooking the bay.  shes dressed in a collared short sleeve shirt, top 2 buttons open and untucked.  short shorts showing off her

long and elegant legs.  she smells of vanilla, its almost addictive.  her hair waving in the soft breeze, fresh, natural.  her eyes

drive me wild, especially when she looks at me that way.  the sun descends towards the horizon, we sit there, talking.  she has

produced another loving cup of coffee, one that i'll never be able to recreate.  theres no pressure, no external stress.  just us.

she wants nothing except my love, which i offer freely.  i want nothing, but to know she knows i love her.  the kind where u dont

need gifts.  the kind that means she'll never love another but me, even in death.  her back, just above her shorts is warm and

receptive to my hand.  with that touch she knows many things.  i reach up, tickling her spine, slipping my arm underneath her shirt.

 we just lie there, soaking up the retreating sun, faces into the breeze.  her cheek is against mine, then she slips her head down

like im her father, and she loves her dad.  shes listening to my easy heart-beat.  i rest my chin on top of her head and embrace

her.  she feels safe in my arms.  then my leg starts getting sore and i grin and bear it, cos nothing can stop this moment.  this is

perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradually the catamaran moves with the receding tide, we're blissfully unaware of the boats gradual motion out

towards deep water.  But thats OK, cos we're moving with it.  Im belly down in water, with my head below the surface.  There is a

clicking sound coming from beneath the numerous finger corals.  Its almost eerie, there should be no sound down here save our

kicking in the water.  The water is just cool enough to feel it, the sun heats my back.  This is perfect.  You're here, in this

liquid kingdom with me.  After a few hours semi-submerged, I get back onboard and help you up.  In the frige there is fresh fruit

juice and the sandwiches we prepared earlier.  Nourishing baguettes, cut into small portions exposing the fillings of roast beef,

gouda cheese, tomato and of course fresh ground pepper.  We sit there on the deck, the sun gently greeting the ocean at the end of

our scope.  The sun and horizon become one, there is love all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm so cross with myself over you.  You complete me then break me.  Why?
I realise just how much you take advantage of me, and it hurts.  I don't want to be in this situation, I'm afraid of the grey.  Why

can't it just be black and white hmm?  Instead you leave me trapped here in no-mans-land, halfway between the gutter and stars.  I'm

just a mealpacket in the wind, swept up in this maelstrom you call your life.  I'm dodging the hungry birds, and reaching for the

trees to bring me back to ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pop the cap, flick the drip&lt;br /&gt;
Pat the arm, insert the tip&lt;br /&gt;
Push the plunge, breathe in deep.&lt;br /&gt;
Release the pressure, fall fast asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is what you are for me&lt;br /&gt;
You're my drug, You're my symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;
You're evil yet required cos you're good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're bad for me, but you make me feel good.&lt;br /&gt;
When I don't see you, I feel alone.&lt;br /&gt;
When I'm with you, I feel alone.&lt;br /&gt;
When I'm not feeling alone, its cos I'm not thinking of you.&lt;br /&gt;
You break me, then make me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're like Morphine.  You kill my pain, but I want to be in pain, so you can cure it, just for this hit, just for any hit.
You feel so good, coursing through my veins, making me ignore my pain.  But you put me in pain, you ARE my pain.  The worst bit is,

I don't know where to find you, you come to me, and I'm a junkie.  I willfully oblige, I'm powerless.
Every shot is timed.  You're riding the highway to my heart, straight through the jugular.  You're a super-car with a rod of flint

igniting off the railing all the way on this one-way-route to bliss.  You ignore the speed limit, carelessly over-taking molecules,

avoiding the barriers with dilligent reflexes.  You're accelerating as you near your intended destination, to deliver your payload

of pleasure.  Wait! I'm so unprepared for it!  STOP! STOP BEFORE YOU KILL US BOTH!  YOU'RE MAD!  ARRRGGHHH AHHHHHHH ahhhhhhhhh,

wooahhh, no ways.  Wow!  Do it again!  What!?  Why not?!?  Come on for fucks sake!  WHY?!?! What the fuck!  GET OUTTA MY FACE!  I

DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!  WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following entries were dedicated to &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/magependragon" title="browse.to: Pen Dragon's

Journal"&gt;Magependragon&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-stream, a flow of thought and action, finds itself transferred to another medium.  The medium doesn't matter,

but the translation does.  Its an artform, not the paint that paints it, but how it is painted... Its the stroke of the brush, the

thick laying of media.  The paint ripples behind the brush, leaving an undulated texture of chaos, that chaos that binds us. The

finishing of the stroke thru the action.  That paint, how simple it is, how it can be interpretated in so many ways, how it talks to

people who are willing to listen.  Its showing off for me, it dances before my eyes, seductively.  Dances, dances in a way that

defies my own inhibitions.  It is a drug for thine eyes, carelessly I absorb it, and it absorbs me.  We become one.  I don't need a

specific sense to know it is there, cos I can FEEL it.  It touches me inside.  I feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silohuetted against a setting sun sky is a magnificent oak tree.  Its a wise old tree, a careful parent.  Underneath its

sheltering branches we spent some undying moments.  Those sort of moments you'll dream of in your sleep in the next world.  Hell, if

the next world was to be perfect, it would be underneath that grand old oak tree.  The wind whistles slowly through the leaves in

the top branches, a soothing sound, giving the tree an impression of youthful animation.  An aura of respect surrounds the tree for

a hundred meters, here everything is in balance.  I remember falling asleep in this idyll, I remember sleeping in its loving hands

and you were there beside me.  It was the sweat and blood of pleasant dreams.  I remember waking with you.  Your hair, joyfully

playing with the wind, full of life.  Your eyes, sparkling with anticipation.  Your lips, ripe with flavour.  Your face, in my

hands.  You're into me, and I into you.  There is no distraction.  How I wish this moment could go on and on and on, a memory is but

a sad attempt at reincarnation.  I know now that I'm ready to pass on, cos I have felt love to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a spirit, care-free-floating.  I can go anywhere I want.  I've been to all the ends of the earth, watching these silly

mortals go about their little lives, lives that are miniscule next to the scheme of things.  Theres one thing about these mortals

though, they have the equal capacity for greatness as they do archaic evil.  I'm just interested in the good though, I've been

cataloguing it as it happens.  But I'm worried, its waning.  Evil has taken hold of these emotional lemmings.  I can't help but

think they're asking for it, the next deluge.  The previous generation never teaches the next.  Sure, they've tried, but the

inheritors aren't even trying to listen and learn.  Why is that so?  Maybe its just a chronological influence, as you get older you

come to realise theres more to life than getting to your destination.  Who in their right mind would want to die?  Is there a right

mind?  I move on, these humans tire me.  There are much better beings to observe in this rich myriad we call life.  My particular

favourites include a race raised in the cradle of life itself.  They've been around almost as long as I, and even they think like

timeless lightsources, trapped in overbearing shells.  There sense in lack of immortality punishes them, but they respect the cycle.

 They understand that their mortal life is a time of teaching, a time to understand yourself.  I smile knowing that for ignorance

there is also great insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spiritual Enema&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so disappointed right now.  For the last 3 hours I've been asking all those nasty questions like: How do I want to be remembered?  How could I describe my life at this moment?  Am I happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went for a "date" with DeeDee, it was more like meeting a new friend.  Why does it have to feel like a date.  I sorta want it to be a date, I think DeeDee could be a great partner through life, but why am I thinking that?  Do I need a partner right now?  What makes me ask that in the first place.  I'm so confused right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into the date with too many expectations I guess, once again.  I'm trying too hard to start everything right now.  So, had a chat to our resident grey-kop-slash-wise-man Katarn, and we got talking about concepts of Zen, Karma, relationships, friendships etc.  Katarn surprised me at first with his wealth of wisdom, objective view on life.  Now I rely on it when I get the opportunity.  Our chat got me thinking about my direction in life, my way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I want to be remembered?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think I'd be happy knowing that people knew I was happy through life, or developed a zest for life.  Someone who set goals and achieved them.  Someone that loved and was loved.  Someone that would be missed.  How goes that plan right now Shaun?  I'll get back to you on that :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would I describe my life right now?&lt;/strong&gt; I'm an emotional traveller.  I have suffered but I'm trying hard to be positive, this road is rough, but I'm wearing my new boots.  I don't have much to my name and part of me wants to keep it that way, it means I'm more mobile.  At times I feel empty or unappreciated but I know my time is coming. There is always room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I happy?&lt;/strong&gt; I have everything to live for.  An exciting career, enough money to keep me out of debt, dreams, friends, family.  Am I happy?!?!  I'm trying hard.  There are times like now, where I put on some emotional music, question my happiness and I just want to cry the healthy cry.  Come on Shaun, Are you happy or not!  Fuck.  Music makes me happy.  Knowing I'm loved makes me happy.  Knowing I'm accepted makes me happy.  Why should the happiness of others over me dictate my own happiness?  I want to be selfish but I can't, I'd feel unhappy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emptiness, cold-dark and lonely. Destination: Happiness, warm-light and lovely.  I am that man on the road, journeying alongside the highway of life.  I'm not looking for a lift, my feet work fine, but an offer wouldn't hurt. One step after the next, each step forward is a step closer to the horizon.  My shoes don't fit me just right, they're too new.  The laces come undone too easily too.  I want to ride my bike rather, but I realise that would be cheating.  I've just gotta keep on walking, through the sleet, through the harsh sun, through the refreshing breezes, through the meadows accompanied by the jubilent twittering of jays and larks.  I'm almost there, I'm getting used to the pace.  What happens when I get there?  I hope they've got a nice meal cooked for me.  Who is gonna be at the end?  I want to see familiar faces there.  I want to feel like I've arrived home.  Isn't my home here on the highway, am I not just a beggar of the bi-ways?  I wander into the road like a drunk, I am roadkill.  There are no cars while I stumble on the asphalt, not a car in sight.  Typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel better now, thanks for being here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hopeless / O'Bliss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an awesome week I've had, I hope all 3 of you reading are jealous, just cos I used the word "awesome" again. Friday morning, woke up at 0430, cruised through to the airport at 0530 only to queue for an hour.  Its all worth it I guess since the ticket cost R550 return (be jealous some more mortals!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday was tiring, helping out with the wedding plans, since I was staying with the family.  I haven't seen these people for 4 years but it felt like I was just there yesterday.  &lt;em&gt;I've never drunk so much over such an extended period.&lt;/em&gt; Saturday was better, went to see some more folks, catch up on the happenings.  One such enlightening topic of conversation was the following...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back a dear family of friends lost their mother to a suicide. For ages we questioned why, such a selfish thing to do, especially with having 2 children to leave behind.  Well, those questions were answered in a way, turns out the father was an abuser.  While suicide is not the answer, I can understand why such action was taken. Problem is, the lesson hasn't been learnt and the father is still an abusive prick. even to his new s/o.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was one theme for this week though, it would have to be love.  The wedding was beautiful, the bride and groom made a picture-perfect couple, relatives came from far and wide yet the reception reeked of debauchery.  I have never seen people trying so hard to get drunk.  I have never seen such open pervertedness in the form of the groom's father, chatting and getting &lt;acronym title="Touchy-Feely"&gt;vatterig&lt;/acronym&gt; with all the women except his wife at the wedding reception.  A stuffed up speech from the father of the bride.  Such things happen I guess, pass me another beer please Mr. Waiter.  But wow, such gorgeous women.  :) (Before and after the beers, or was I merry the whole weekend?!?)  Didn't have much oppurtunity to ask for phone numbers and such, as they either had jocks attached to their shoulders or I didn't bother.  Do I have to bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, met up with some more mates, caught up on old times, watched some TV for the first time in months. ("Birdy" is a hectic psychological drama.) Monday was equally chilled, and ended when I flew back at 2000, 45 minutes of chatting, to a special someone.  So I asked for her number...  :)  Ever have that, where you talk, and she/he listens and actually adds value to the conversation?  I felt like I could talk to her about anything and she would still be interested.  I'm looking forward to meeting her a second time, She's great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that moment I wore my heart on my sleeve.  I was open for abuse, but also open to honesty, love, compassion. She had the key, opened my lock with a click, the key was engineered to fit.  Inside, machinations occured, it was a natural process.  Why did it have to be locked in the first place?  With a creaky tug, the door popped open and all the goodness from within was revealed.  Eyes onto focused retinas relayed images of a bond.  A hand reach in and touched the inside.  Touch is the best of the 5 senses without a doubt.  Its eternal, occurs all over, works both ways.  Sight is selfish, sound is selective, smell is 1 dimensional, taste is tasteless, but when two people come together and touch, there is a conduit of feeling, a bridge of thought.  Don't abuse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back from an awesome break.  Feeling wasted-tired, will feel wasted-tired tomorrow too when I wake up at 0430.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm reading ChickenHawk by Robert Mason, an autobiography by a American Vietnam Chopper Pilot. Just what I need to read: war stories are great emotional trips, add my dreams of being a chopper pilot and you've got a book I actually &lt;em&gt;WANT&lt;/em&gt; to read.  In between the reading I was somewhere halfway to Maputo, enjoying the crisp escarpment air, wild sounds and of course the smell of thatch and bushveld.  Oh, and coughing on second-hand tobacco smoke.  *sigh*.  3/5 days were spent indoors due to the rain, but it was great to be out there again.  The house we stayed in was absolutely amazing, dressed to the nines, making &lt;acronym title="Johannesburg"&gt;JHB&lt;/acronym&gt; North homes look like houses-of-cards.  7 of us, our own bush-spotting land rover and 5 days to do anything we wanted.  So we drank, played games, drove the &lt;q&gt;"landie"&lt;/q&gt; stukkend.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can like to wear a jean pant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its been good to be distant for a while, switched off my cellphone, and focused on chilling out. What really irked me about the weekend was the total lack of nature-appreciation.  Are we losing touch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There I was, finally alone.  I was at my most humble here, naked in thought. I understood the balance, the right and the wrong, equal in measure but never dealt when not required.  I lived off the land and the land lived off me.  That moment was all defining, when it stood out of the bush and motioned towards me.  Sheepishly watching my reaction,s ready to bolt at a hint of aggresiveness.  Humans can't be trusted.  I stood still until I realised how I looked.  Knees in the earth, face in the grass I opened myself up.  She dropped her guard a little and came closer.  I could smell her now.  Warm, wet, her tongue tickled my ear, I chuckled under my breath then slowly let it out, she continued.  I lifted my head and felt loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;night, goodmorning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DruggedDepression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You love me so, You hate me so. I love you too, I wish you could visit more often. People from outside want to split us apart, who do they think they are! We were born, bred, matured for each other!  Where are you going? Don't leave me!  You need me as much as I need you, we're like the ocean and the land, we make beaches, we craft rock scultures.  Our creations are uniquely beautiful. We cannont exist without eachother.  Exist! One S short and you're gone.  Come back!  What do I have if you're gone?!  Gayness, thats what.  Happy bouncing, its silly.  I don't want to smile, I like to frown, feel down, so down. Get back here you grey fader! I feel empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is addictive.  I've been to rehab.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appearance vs Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today was shaveathon day, yesterday like a big deal I setup a pact with Carla that if she dyes her hair, or even better, attempts to shave it off I would do the same.  Carla chickened out as I thought she would (for a shave that is), but it was still fun trying to instil some nerves :)  So, I went along and similarly copped out and got a number 2, to at least give my scalp some sunshine for a week or so.  Next week, its coming off! Oh, that reminds me, I'm not here next week! \o/  Back to the subject at hand, Many guys were getting their pips scoured, so they were really getting into the spirit of things, but I couldn't help but think how many of the people were truly doing it for Cancer...  Thats my curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carla and I had a one-sided chat on the image thing, How many girls can really say they can shave their heads and not feel anything?  How many guys for that matter?  I was worried about the image thing in my own instance.  Why do we have to conform to a social template?  What or who engineered this social template?  I think hollywood has its part to play in many social aspects, such as image, relationships, style.  Are we doomed to die as Narcissus?
&lt;dfn&gt;"One day Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a spring and, in desperation, killed himself."&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, pay R50 for a good cause, and a bad haircut. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My scheduled lack of appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite the schedule for a home-boi, Sunday morning, mission off to a private game farm in Lydenburg owned by Roxanne's (Dave's girlfriend) family. (... garden-boy's-ex-lover's-dogwalker ...), return Thursday, only to get onto a Durban bound plane early on Friday for the weekend-long wedding of a distant family friend, then crawl back into the office on Monday afternoon.  Phew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game farm is gonna rock, Just about 8 or so of us, a well-stocked holiday retreat, starry skies.  I've been missing doing such things, As a kid we always used to be in the bush, in touch with Nature. (No, not like &lt;acronym title="Dudditts the wonder-boi"&gt;uDu&lt;/acronym&gt; style :P) I used to be a keen bird-watcher, feathered variety too, but you kinda get bored of these dodgy Indian Myna's in urban life.  Taking the bike, hiking shoes and floppy hat along too, can't wait to hit some jeep trails!  Thankfully / Unfortunately the game farm doesn't have any obnoxiously dangerous animals, which means daywalks are allowed unguided - just gotta watch out for them leopards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wedding is going to be another saga on its own.  I hate churches.  I like the philosopy that is religion, but you won't catch me being one of the sheep, err, lambs.  I haven't seen Debby for ages, I just hope her fiance isn't a total jock, she's always deserved better than beer-slugging rugby-watching womanisers.  Anyway, going with my Mom, which will be kewl, haven't seen her for 3 months. :/  So yeah, I'll be there, watching another union.  Just as much as I hate churches, I think marriage is just as useless.  Well, thats my dad's fault, say no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blogging, Journalling and me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I face a dilemna.  Do I write for me, or write for my buds?  Keeping a journal has always been a way to get things off my shoulders, writing down intimate thoughts and reviewing them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a livejournal after not doing much research into blogging, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I like and respect the community features as &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/magependragon/" title="browse.to: Pen Dragon's Journal"&gt;magependragon&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, but I don't have as much control over the content as I would have liked (and have found on &lt;a href="http://ndorfin.blogspot.com" title="browse.to: m e t a - p h o r i c a l / a m p h e t a m i n e"&gt;blogspot&lt;/a&gt;).  I think I'll just mirror blogs...  Maybe look at totally hacking the Stylesheet Overrides for LiveJournal.  OK, so I'm an aspiring web-standards-developer, I want my sites to look good, and behave themselves technically, Livejournal is limited that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just technical standards, why am I blogging anyway?  Maybe its kinda selfish, but I write for me first.  Its also an experiment in getting my emotions out there, an experiment in becoming an Extrovert.  &lt;acronym title="Myers Briggs Type: Introvert-iNtuition-Feeling-Perception"&gt;INFP&lt;/acronym&gt; becomes &lt;acronym title="Myers Briggs Type: Extrovert-iNtuition-Feeling-Perception"&gt;ENFP&lt;/acronym&gt;?  This I gotta see, &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/magependragon/" title="browse.to: Pen Dragon's Journal"&gt;magependragon&lt;/a&gt; would understand :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Falling in Love is hard on the needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, mutual love, true love, have you ever tried it?  When you say: "I love you", do you know that you don't really need to say it?  Does she know that you love her?  I'm still open to the idea of the relationship built on love, I'm still open to the idea that your soulmate is alive and well, you're just not keeping your eyes open through your journey of life.  Funny how others think that is a total pipe-dream.  If you stop looking for Mrs. Right, you won't find them.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Get out the car, talk a walk around, smell the flowers bud.  Yes, that is sunlight beaming down on you, it warms you up from the inside.  Thats where I'll find you, warming under the rays. You'll be carefree, dressed for you.  You're somteimes a dirty driver through life, you push others off the road and then feel terrible afterwards, stopping the car and turning around, just to make sure your hapless victim is OK under the circumstances.  Most of the time though, you're patient, stopping to let the wild-life cross the road, admiring the innocent beauty.  You enjoy the ride through life, as it defines you.  You can't stand the BMW's and Porches of the road, how can people be so vain and arrogant! They're always driving in the emergency lane too, "That part of the road has a purpose you selfish prick." you mutter to yourself.  When you pull over, you can't help but notice how fast these people drive!  What the hell &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; their hurry.  You hardly see anyone stopped by the side of the road when you're travelling, its weird that way.  Life is a choice of roads, sometimes the route plan is made up far in advance, other times congestion in the roads or convenience dictates your choice of Bi-way.  I wonder where that puts a traffic cop?  Mom, I never knew you were a Spietkop! *gasp*  What about road construction or alterations?  What about traffic lights and pavements?  What happens when you run a red-light?  Where do all these roads go... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Truth is in here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jungian Philosophy: If I understand myself, I am better suited at understanding the world around me.&lt;br /&gt;-- Thanks Darryl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.podbox.co.za/cowblog/" title="browse.to: Cowblog"&gt;Warcow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/magependragon" title="browse.to: Pen Dragon's Journal"&gt;Magependragon&lt;/a&gt; kicked me in the ass and got me blogging. So here it is, my first &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; entry.  Should I say what I feel, or censor things?  I'd like to think I'm honest, but I worry about putting my thoughts online for all to see.  Sure, I can cater for friends, registered users, but its the thought in general thats disturbing.  A journal is inherently private, let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The boys in blue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smurfing is rampant in gaming, and as Karl suggested: &lt;q&gt;"suits the introvert"&lt;/q&gt;.  I think its dishonourable, as a non-smurfer.  I'd prefer to know who I'm playing against, I'd like to say Hi to clanmates and friends, not have them play as someone else behind my back.  I can understand smurfing where those close to you know who you're playing as, it adds fun to the game by being cheddary with your nick.  If you think smurfing gives you the right to be a total smacktard, please leave my planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assimilated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got thinking today about &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com" title="browse.to: LiveJournal"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.deviantart.com" title="browse.to: Deviant Art"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;.  They're containers for thought and expression.  We have online banking portals for our money, personal sites to store our &lt;acronym title="Currciulum Vitae / Resume"&gt;CVs&lt;/acronym&gt; and portfolios.  How long before you start storing other things within technology.  What if the internet is a collective?!  The internet cloud could form a charter of human history, a knowledge base of the human mind, a template of human existence.  Scary.  Next time we send a deep-space probe into the furthest reaches of our galaxy, we should send a censored copy of the internet along too :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Economy:Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any assessment has been done in South Africa regarding traffic, stress and the economy?  I get stressed driving in bad traffic, often leaving me with a crap feeling when I finally arrive at work. Bad drivers are one thing, but a bad traffic system is worse.  How difficult is it to synchronise traffic lights?! You leave the one robot, drive at the speed limit, and wham, greeted with another red robot.  This not only is a total waste of petrol but puts more wear on the clutch, brakes, suspension etc.  Even in a matrix of robots, there must be a way to synch them.  Also something scary, is how often particular traffic lights fail, show incorrect lights, have missing lights.  What about delivery systems?  How much fat is added to the time taken to deliver a package?!  Surely improving the time spent in traffic means you can deliver more per day!?  Maybe I just think like a first world pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friends:Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to the idea that you are the product of your friends at any given time.  You, or your friends outgrow each other, some friendships last forever, others were based on a need or a scenario.  The same goes for music.  I think about how much I've changed over the last 10 years and how my style of music has changed too.  Sure, I still love rock, but I'm more open to other genres at the moment.  Before I used to switch off to anything that didn't appeal to my explicit taste in grungy rock music.  Now R&amp;B / HipHop, Metal, heck even Pop has a place in my listening queue.  Music, like a good friend is an awesome thing to have in life.  Now if only I could find the mix between the two, my soulmate would be a rock ballad.&lt;/p&gt;
