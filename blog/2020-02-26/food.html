          Oh, how I lust after hamburgers and fries. Or chocolate.
        <p>
          Loïc and I quickly ran out of our own local treats we brought over. Two rusks per student and staff meant they evaporated in two tea times, and the amazing Belgian chocolate was <i>Destroyed in Seconds</i>™. Since then, it's been more difficult to consume processed sweet things.

        <h3>The meals</h3>
        <p>
          The school budget is pretty tight on food, so we tend to get produce in bulk from the local market. Think brown (and even red!) rice. Think corn kernels. Think boiled.
        <p>

        <p>
          Malagasy meals mainly consist of rice or <i lang="mg">vary</i>, with a side dish or <i lang="mg">ro</i>. The side dish is a quarter of the size of the rice dish. Most Malagasy families are considered fortunate to have a side-dish.
        <p>
          Side-dishes can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Local leaves
          <li>Pumpkin (with smashed peanuts - imagine peanut butter and pumpkin together)
          <li>Tilapia (a common fresh-water fish) in broth
          <li>Shrimps and a spinach-like leaf
          <li>Mixed vegetables (sometimes with beef)
          <li>Eggs with unidentifiable greens (tastes amazing!)
        </ul>
        <p>
          I can't reason with the quantities though. Everyone packs away an amazing amount of rice with each meal, and yet still look lean. We all learned (via the grapevine) that carbs are evil, right? It doesn't seem so in our situation here, but maybe there's another side to the equation here I'm not accounting for, possibly the burn-off.

        <h3>Epic Meal Time</h3>
        <p>
          We sit on woven mats that cover the kitchen floor. Then we place special mats (or <i lang="mg">fandambanana</i>) in the centre to act as the table, it is considered very rude to step over this mat, or to put anything but food or drink on the fandambanana.
        <p>
          After the faithful finish their prayer, we tuck in. There's an order to things here, and as a slow eater I'm letting the side down. See, I'm the oldest in the school, (I never thought that would happen!) and, as is custom, the oldest must dictate when the next course (mainly fresh fruit such as bananas or litchis) can be eaten.
        </p>

          <figcaption>We get two types of litchis here, this one is particularly different to the litchis we grew up with.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We often have hot milk (which makes it sweeter) as a drink with lunch, but mostly we have water on the side.
