    I gave this talk at <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonCSS/events/223141830/">Wellingtonâ€™s CSS meetup</a> in June, 2015. It was well-received, but could have been better from my point of view.

    Sharing what we learned using Angular.js as a clickthrough tool
  description: |-
    <p>Following some recent UX work we did at Kiwibank, we shared what we did with the larger Abletech team.
    <p>We used Angular.js as a rich prototyping tool, building static screens to emulate what the customer would experience with a proposed system.
    <p>We then tested the prototype with some real potential users!
