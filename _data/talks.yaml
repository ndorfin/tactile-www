    I gave this talk at <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonCSS/events/223141830/">Wellingtonâ€™s CSS meetup</a> in June, 2015. It was well-received, but could have been better from my point of view.

    Sharing what we learned using Angular.js as a clickthrough tool
  description: |-
    <p>Following some recent UX work we did at Kiwibank, we shared what we did with the larger Abletech team.
    <p>We used Angular.js as a rich prototyping tool, building static screens to emulate what the customer would experience with a proposed system.
    <p>We then tested the prototype with some real potential users!

    Sophie Price and I presented the work we did on a bespoke design system at KiwiRuby 2019.
  description: |-
    <p>After more than a year of writing hand-crafted HTML and CSS, and my colleague Sophie wrangling all the design assets, and producing some incredible screens, we started meeting in the middle with our own design system.</p>
    <p>It was a fantastic journey and we learned many things along the way. But the best part is that it is useful, and is being used.</p>
    <p>This talk covers some of our rationale, shares some of our lessons, and hopefully inspired the ~200 delegates of KiwiRuby to build their own.</p>
