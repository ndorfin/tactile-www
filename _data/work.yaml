  title: Birds of Zevenwacht
  summary: |-
    Web and data design, followed by web development on a community-driven project that extends my love for bird-watching
  description: |-
    <p>A freelance community project to catalogue sightings and photos of birds in my neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>The site contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>over 150 bird species and their data
      <li>over 300 bird photos from several contributors
      <li>hundreds of logged sightings of birds
      <li>bounded areas of the various farms and housing estates in the area
      <li>metadata such as cameras used, EXIFs, bird lists, and geolocation of sightings and photos
    </ul>
  observations:
    - I respect product and web designers a lot more after working on this project; good design is difficult but important work
    - View Transitions are amazingly simple to implement
    - It's time to start using an application server like Django or Rails
    - Custom Sighting and Photo data could be better integrated with SABAP2 formats
  responsibilities:
    - Created a photo EXIF-reading tool to generate data stubs, minimising content entry responsibilities
    - Creating JSON Schemas for data entry, to minimse problems with the YAML data entries
    - Responsive image generation in AVIF format, falling back to JPEG
    - Web development with Eleventy
    - PWA features

  title: A UI overhaul of SASTI
  summary: |-
    Replacing the UI of an aging Django app for Stellenbosch University's CREST team
  description: |-
    <p>
      SASTI is a decades old web-based analytics app that reports on tertiary education performance in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 5 months, I first started by building a component/pattern library (for the Python developers) based on some previous design work.<br>
      I then set about replacing the current UI (in DTL) with Jinja2, removing a lot of burdensome JavaScript, and implemented Web Platform tech such as Web Components.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to learn more Python (and Django) on the job. While I miss Rails' "Convention over Configuration", I enjoyed the openness, community help, and helpful documentation of Django.
    </p>
  observations:
    - Django is a delight to work with
    - Web Components can help ease a lot of the front-end load for other developers; it's much easier to write HTML than learn a new JavaScript package API.
    - I wish there was a designer on this project, but we managed to get by.
    - Working with Web Platform tech meant we didn't need to incorporate Node (and its heavy dependencies) in the Python environment
  responsibilities:
    - Switched to Jinja2 for templating
    - Built and maintained a pattern library, based on previous design work
    - Implemented a number of Web Components that made the back-end developer's life a lot easier
    - Refactor Views and View architecture

    Cursory low-level design, content modelling, and development of ZX Security's public-facing website.

    <p>While working at Ackama, the ideal project happened my way: A Jekyll-driven static site for a great little IT security company.</p>
  people:
    - Marc McHardy (Lead Designer)
    - Chris Hails (Content)
    - Simon Howard (Owner)
    - Kim Partridge (Project management)
  observations:
    - It was rewarding working with a tech-competent client, who had an existing workflow for publishing their site content.
  responsibilities:
    - Low-fideltiy design exploration with <a href="https://marcmchardy.com/">Marc</a>
    - Translation of existing flat content to a Jekyll data-driven system
    - URL audit and mapping of existing content to new content
    - Content modelling in Jekyll using a combination of markdown and YAML.
    - Minor performance improvements
    - Front-end development, testing.
    - Progressive-enhancement techniques used and PWA foundations set.

  title: Yarra Valley Water's website
  summary: |-
    A large scale Drupal implementation with bespoke design
  description: |-
    <p>
      While working at Ackama, I was tasked with redoing the front-end of a Drupal app for a Water Utility company called Yarra Valley Water.<br>
      Suzanne had already done the design work, so it was my turn to implement her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some help from my more knowledgable Ackama Drupal colleagues, I then set about replacing the Twig templates, CSS, and supporting content.<br>
      Most of the content types are modular, so it was a case of working one by one until the pages looked right.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I neared completion, I started testing for regressions, as well as doing an audit of existing vs. new pages, making sure to minimise 404s.
    </p>
  people:
    - Kim Partridge (Project management)
    - Suzanne Conkas (UX Designer)
  observations:
    - I wish I had the time/skills to improve Drupal's front-end performance. All the JavaScript it ships by default, unbundled, is a problem.
  responsibilities:
    - Transform design work to front-end code.
    - Mobile-first reposonsive design implementation
    - Accessibility concerns
    - Testing for UI regressions
    - Documentation

  title: Lil Regie's Workshop & Website
  summary: |-
    Building, documenting and testing UI patterns for Lil Regie so that they can build extensive front-ends.
  description: |-
    <p>Lil Regie had a design done by Tim James for their new site, and they wanted a CMS-powered website to go with it. So I set about making a pattern library, which we called <i>Lil Regie's Front-end Workshop</i>. The Workshop included a static representation of the homepage, which was later used in their live site.</p>
  people:
    - Tim James (designer)
    - Steve Hoeksema (CTO)
    - Juri Hahn (Senior developer)
    - The rest of the Lil Regie team
  observations:
    - <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">StimulusJS</a> is a smart and friendly library to work with
    - CSS custom properties continue to blow my mind
    - CSS Grid's named template areas have amazing adaptability
    - GitHub's private NPM registry and GitHub Actions work well
  responsibilities:
    - Cross-browser testing
    - Documenting all the components used in the Pattern library
    - Building a bespoke pattern library with Middleman

    A chance to share what I've learned, and empower those less fortunate than myself.

  title: The Flick design system
  summary: |-
    A bespoke Design System, helping several front-ends stay consistent and reliable.
  description: |-
    <p>Together with Kah Chan, Sophie Price, Everton Fragoso, and various other friends at Flick, we built a bespoke design system that serves more than 7 front-ends.</p>
  people:
    - Kah Chan, Product designer
    - Sophie Price, Senior Designer
    - Everton Fragoso, Full-stack developer
  observations:
    - Framework-agnostic pattern libraries are more portable
    - People drive design systems within companies more than the tech
    - Communicating breaking changes is a vital responsibility of any code library
    - Using arbitrary breakpoints is less valuable than making components responsive without media queries
  responsibilities:
    - Majority of the front-end development
    - Front-end team lead, and mentor.
    - Development of the static site, using Middleman.
    - Rollout of package releases

    - Trade Me's Product Design team
  observations:
    - "CSS's <code>pointer-events: none;</code> is an anti-pattern."
    - Design systems should start with documentation first
    - Creating accessible web properties is a top-to-bottom responsibility
    - Working against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">the Principle of Least Power</a> makes the resulting work fragile
  responsibilities:
    - Angular component development and conceptualisation
    - Feasibility studies and component prototyping
    - Component cross-browser testing
    - Component unit testing
