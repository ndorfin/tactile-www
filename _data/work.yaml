  people:
    - Trade Me's full-time Tangram Developers

  observations:

    - Working against [the Principle of Least Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) makes the resulting work fragile

    - Angular component development and conceptualisation
    - Feasibility studies and component prototyping
