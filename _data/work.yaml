  title: Teaching web development
  summary: |-
    A chance to share what I've learned, and empower those less fortunate than myself.
  description: |-
    I took on a 9-month contract in the small town of Mahanoro on the east coast of Madagascar, to teach web development (and related disciplines) to 20 Malagasy students, in their second year of becoming web developers.
    You can read about my experiences with this project on <a href="/blog/">my blog</a>
  people:
    - Onja's administration team
    - Lo√Øc Pinois, fellow Front-end development teacher
  observations:
    - Communication comes first
    - Tech is inherently biased towards native English speakers
    - Abstractions can be harmful
  responsibilities:
    - Teaching HTML, CSS, and classic front-end development using a custom curriculum
    - Teaching Git, bash, VS Code, and other tools we use for our projects
    - Running extra lessons
    - Marking assessments and quizzes

  title: The Flick design system
  summary: |-
    A bespoke Design System, helping several front-ends stay consistent and reliable.
  description: |-
    Together with Kah Chan, Sophie Price, Everton Fragoso, and various other friends at Flick, we built a bespoke design system that serves more than 7 front-ends.
  people:
    - Kah Chan, Product designer
    - Sophie Price, Senior Designer
    - Everton Fragoso, Full-stack developer
  observations:
    - Framework-agnostic pattern libraries are more portable
    - People drive design systems within companies more than the tech
    - Communicating breaking changes is a vital responsibility of any code library
    - Using arbitrary breakpoints is less valuable than making components responsive without media queries
  responsibilities:
    - Majority of the front-end development
    - Front-end team lead, and mentor.
    - Development of the static site, using Middleman.
    - Rollout of package releases
    - Implementation of releases in the various front-ends
    - Migration of Rails front-ends to support our package releases

  title: Trade Me's Tangram
  summary: |-
    Contract work on one of NZ's biggest Design Systems
  description: |-
    As one of 7 CSS developers, and countless Angular devs, I helped build out patterns for Trade Me's design system: Tangram.
  people:
    - Trade Me's full-time Tangram Developers
    - Trade Me's Product Design team
  observations:
    - "CSS's <code>pointer-events: none;</code> is an anti-pattern."
    - Design systems should start with documentation first
    - Creating accessible web properties is a top-to-bottom responsibility
    - Working against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">the Principle of Least Power</a> makes the resulting work fragile
  responsibilities:
    - Angular component development and conceptualisation
    - Feasibility studies and component prototyping
    - Component cross-browser testing
    - Component unit testing
