  title: Birds of Zevenwacht
  summary: |-
    Web and data design, followed by web development on a community-driven project that extends my love for bird-watching
  description: |-
    <p>A freelance community project to catalogue sightings and photos of birds in my neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>The site contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>over 150 bird species and their data
      <li>over 300 bird photos from several contributors
      <li>hundreds of logged sightings of birds
      <li>bounded areas of the various farms and housing estates in the area
      <li>metadata such as cameras used, EXIFs, bird lists, and geolocation of sightings and photos
    </ul>
  observations:
    - I respect product and web designers a lot more after working on this project; good design is difficult but important work
    - View Transitions are amazingly simple to implement
    - It's time to start using an application server like Django or Rails
    - Custom Sighting and Photo data could be better integrated with SABAP2 formats
  responsibilities:
    - Created a photo EXIF-reading tool to generate data stubs, minimising content entry responsibilities
    - Creating JSON Schemas for data entry, to minimse problems with the YAML data entries
    - Responsive image generation in AVIF format, falling back to JPEG
    - Web development with Eleventy
    - PWA features

  title: Lil Regie's Workshop & Website
  summary: |-
    Building, documenting and testing UI patterns for Lil Regie so that they can build extensive front-ends.
  description: |-
    <p>Lil Regie had a design done by Tim James for their new site, and they wanted a CMS-powered website to go with it. So I set about making a pattern library, which we called <i>Lil Regie's Front-end Workshop</i>. The Workshop included a static representation of the homepage, which was later used in their live site.</p>
  people:
    - Tim James (designer)
    - Steve Hoeksema (CTO)
    - Juri Hahn (Senior developer)
    - The rest of the Lil Regie team
  observations:
    - <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">StimulusJS</a> is a smart and friendly library to work with
    - CSS custom properties continue to blow my mind
    - CSS Grid's named template areas have amazing adaptability
    - GitHub's private NPM registry and GitHub Actions work well
  responsibilities:
    - Cross-browser testing
    - Documenting all the components used in the Pattern library
    - Building a bespoke pattern library with Middleman

  summary: |-
    A chance to share what I've learned, and empower those less fortunate than myself.
  description: |-
    <p>I took on a 9-month contract in the small town of Mahanoro on the east coast of Madagascar, to teach web development (and related disciplines) to 20 Malagasy students, in their second year of becoming web developers.</p>
    <p>You can read about my experiences with this project on <a href="/blog/2020-01-01/new-beginnings.html">my blog</a></p>
  people:
    - Onja's administration team
    - Loïc Pinois, fellow Front-end development teacher
  observations:
    - Communication comes first
    - Tech is inherently biased towards native English speakers
    - Abstractions can be harmful
  responsibilities:
    - Teaching HTML, CSS, and classic front-end development using a custom curriculum
    - Teaching Git, bash, VS Code, and other tools we use for our projects

  title: The Flick design system
  summary: |-
    A bespoke Design System, helping several front-ends stay consistent and reliable.
  description: |-

  people:
    - Kah Chan, Product designer
    - Sophie Price, Senior Designer
    - Everton Fragoso, Full-stack developer
  observations:
    - Framework-agnostic pattern libraries are more portable
    - People drive design systems within companies more than the tech
    - Communicating breaking changes is a vital responsibility of any code library
    - Using arbitrary breakpoints is less valuable than making components responsive without media queries
  responsibilities:
    - Majority of the front-end development
    - Front-end team lead, and mentor.
    - Development of the static site, using Middleman.
    - Rollout of package releases

  observations:

  responsibilities:
    - Angular component development and conceptualisation
    - Feasibility studies and component prototyping
    - Component cross-browser testing
    - Component unit testing
